**Status**: Proposed  
**Priority**: Medium - Code quality and consistency  
**Dependencies**: T026 (restructure - optional)  
**Proposed Version**: 1.4.0

Implement a comprehensive Markdown linting system for DOH project to ensure consistent documentation quality, style, and
standards across all .md files.

**Impact**: DOH has extensive Markdown documentation (TODO.md, CHANGELOG.md, docs/, analysis/, etc.) without consistent
style enforcement. A linting system ensures professional documentation quality, catches errors, and maintains
consistency for contributors.

**Technology Decision**: ‚úÖ **markdownlint-cli** (Node.js)

- Chosen for development toolchain (DOH System Development)
- No impact on runtime distribution (stays 100% bash + jq + awk)
- Industry standard with comprehensive rule set
- Excellent CI/CD integration for T024 testing framework

**Tasks**:

- [x] **Technology evaluation**: ‚úÖ markdownlint-cli chosen
- [ ] **Standards definition**: Define DOH Markdown style guide and rules
- [ ] **Configuration creation**: Create linter config file with DOH-specific rules
- [ ] **Tool installation**: Set up chosen linter in project
- [ ] **Integration setup**: Add to package.json/Makefile scripts
- [ ] **CI/CD integration**: Add linting to automated testing pipeline
- [ ] **Pre-commit hooks**: Optional pre-commit markdown validation
- [ ] **Existing files audit**: Run linter on current files and fix issues
- [ ] **Documentation**: Add linting guide to development docs
- [ ] **Testing**: Validate linter catches common markdown issues

**Configuration Considerations**:

- **Line length**: 80/120 chars vs unlimited
- **Headers**: Consistent # spacing, hierarchy validation
- **Lists**: Consistent bullet style, indentation
- **Links**: Validate internal/external link formats
- **Code blocks**: Language specification requirements
- **Tables**: Formatting consistency
- **Trailing whitespace**: Remove vs allow
- **File ending**: Newline requirements

**Integration Options**:

- **Local only**: Manual `npm run lint:md` execution
- **Pre-commit**: Automatic validation before git commits
- **CI/CD**: Automated checking in testing pipeline
- **Editor integration**: VSCode/IDE real-time linting

**Benefits**:

- Consistent documentation style across all contributors
- Catch markdown syntax errors before they reach users
- Professional documentation quality for DOH distribution
- Automated quality enforcement without manual review burden
- Better readability and maintainability of documentation

**Risks & Considerations**:

- May require fixing many existing files initially
- Need balance between strict rules and contributor friction
- Technology choice affects maintenance burden
- Integration complexity with existing DOH toolchain

**Deliverable**: Production-ready Markdown linting system integrated into DOH development workflow with comprehensive
style guide and automated enforcement.

### T030 - Fix Single Source of Truth violations in CLAUDE.md after T026 completion

**Status**: READY (T034 analysis completed - critical issues identified)  
**Priority**: HIGH - Critical for 1.4.0 release consistency  
**Dependencies**: T026 (restructuring completion ‚úÖ), T034 (analysis completed ‚úÖ)  
**Version**: 1.4.0 **Tags**: `#doc` **Analysis**: Part of `analysis/T034-documentation-health-report.md`

Fix Single Source of Truth violations in CLAUDE.md and execute critical architecture reference cleanup identified by
T034 comprehensive documentation audit. This is now a critical 1.4.0 blocker due to 89 outdated architecture references
found.

**Impact**: T034 analysis revealed critical issues beyond CLAUDE.md - 89 outdated architecture references across 15
files create user confusion and command failures. This expanded scope makes it a 1.4.0 release blocker.

**Critical Issues Identified by T034**:

1. **Architecture References (89 total across 15 files)**:
   - "skel/" references: 47 occurrences
   - "templates/" references: 31 occurrences
   - "controlled duplication": 11 occurrences
   - Files: CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/architecture.md, TODO.md, TODOARCHIVED.md, .claude/commands/doh/init.md, others

2. **Version Inconsistencies**:
   - JSON examples using "version": "1.0.0" instead of "1.4.0"
   - Mixed version references across documentation
   - Files: docs/architecture.md:112, analysis/T014-data-structure-analysis.md:39, .claude/commands/doh/agent.md:392

3. **Most Critical Files (per T034)**:
   - CONTRIBUTING.md:90 - Shows old project structure with `skel/`
   - docs/architecture.md:30,34 - References `.claude/doh/templates/`
   - .claude/commands/doh/init.md:216-217 - References old structure

4. **Impact Assessment**:
   - User confusion from inconsistent structure information
   - Command failures from references to non-existent paths
   - Maintenance burden from multiple sources of truth
   - Risk of information drift and inconsistency

**Tasks (T034 Phase 1 - Critical Architecture Cleanup)**:

**High Priority (1.4.0 Blockers)**:

- [ ] **CONTRIBUTING.md:90** - Fix project structure section showing old `skel/` structure
- [ ] **docs/architecture.md:30,34** - Remove references to `.claude/doh/templates/`
- [ ] **CLAUDE.md** - Remove outdated DOH system structure and duplicated planning sections
- [ ] **.claude/commands/doh/init.md:216-217** - Update structure references
- [ ] **Version consistency** - Update JSON examples from "1.0.0" to "1.4.0" in 3 files

**Medium Priority (Quality)**:

- [ ] **TODO.md architecture sections** - Add deprecation notices to old strategy references
- [ ] **TODOARCHIVED.md** - Add clear deprecation notices for controlled duplication strategy
- [ ] **Cross-reference audit** - Scan remaining 10 files with architecture references
- [ ] **Navigation improvements** - Add document map to README.md per T034 recommendations

**Proposed CLAUDE.md Changes**:

Replace sections with:

```markdown
## DOH System Structure

üìÅ **Current Structure**: See `TODO.md` T026 for complete system organization and migration status.

## Task Management

This project uses traditional TODO.md (in project root) for development tasks rather than the /doh system it provides to
other projects.

üìã **Version Management Rules**: See `TODO.md` section "TODO Management" üìÅ **System Structure**: See `TODO.md` T026 for
current organization
```

**Single Source of Truth Enforcement**:

- TODO.md = Source of truth for development tasks, planning, and system structure
- CLAUDE.md = Configuration and brief references only
- No duplication of detailed information between files

**Benefits**:

- Single maintenance point for system structure
- No risk of information drift between files
- Cleaner CLAUDE.md focused on configuration
- Easier updates when structure evolves

**Deliverable**: CLAUDE.md with all Single Source of Truth violations fixed, containing only brief references to TODO.md
for detailed information, ensuring no duplication of system structure or planning details.

### T032 - Design DOH Runtime Build Process (.claude/doh/ as build directory)

**Status**: ACTIVE - Ready for implementation  
**Priority**: Medium - Build system architecture  
**Dependencies**: T031 (architecture decision)  
**Proposed Version**: 1.4.0

Design and implement build process for DOH runtime where `.claude/doh/` contains all runtime components.

**Impact**: Architecture updated - `.claude/doh/` now contains the single source of truth for skel/ and templates/ (no
duplication in project root). Build process focuses on inclaude.md generation from docs/ and maintaining runtime
integrity.

#### Critical Focus: Stable inclaude.md Generation Strategy

For stable version-to-version builds with clean diffs:

**inclaude.md Generation Process**:

1. **Source Analysis**: Read current inclaude.md structure and style
2. **Documentation Mining**: Extract updates from docs/commands.md, docs/architecture.md, WORKFLOW.md
3. **Template Consistency**: Maintain existing sections and formatting patterns
4. **Stable Output**: Ensure deterministic generation (no timestamps, consistent ordering)
5. **Diff Optimization**: Only modify sections that actually changed

**Key Sources for inclaude.md**:

- `docs/commands.md` - Command specifications and natural language usage
- `docs/architecture.md` - Structure, IDs, file organization
- `WORKFLOW.md` - Quick workflow examples
- `.claude/doh/scripts/` - Available runtime commands
- `.claude/commands/` - Claude command implementations and behavior
- `templates/` - Template structure information

**Generation Strategy**:

- Parse existing inclaude.md sections as stable baseline
- Identify which docs sections map to which inclaude.md sections
- Update only changed content, preserve structure and style
- Maintain 2KB optimization target for Claude performance
- Validate generated content matches expected format

**Enhanced Design Questions**:

1. What triggers builds? (version changes, manual, CI/CD)
2. How to validate runtime artifact quality?
3. Should `.claude/doh/` be git-ignored as build output?
4. How to maintain backward compatibility during builds?
5. Which components have been most useful for creating inclaude.md historically?
6. How to ensure deterministic, diff-friendly generation of inclaude.md?

**Revised Architecture Model**:

```text
# Documentation Sources (Project Root)
./docs/                    # Documentation only
./analysis/                # Analysis documents only

# Runtime & Development (.claude/doh/)
.claude/doh/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/               # Runtime scripts (100% bash)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ skel/                  # Skeleton files (single source)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/             # Template files (single source)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inclaude.md           # Generated runtime guide
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/commands/doh/ # Command implementations
```

**Simplified Build Process**:

1. **No Duplication**: skel/ and templates/ exist only in `.claude/doh/` (single source of truth)

2. **Focus on inclaude.md Generation**:
   - Generate optimized inclaude.md from docs/ sources
   - Maintain skel/ and templates/ directly in .claude/doh/
   - No copying needed for runtime functionality

3. **Build Validation**:
   - Verify inclaude.md generation quality
   - Check skel/ integrity for /doh:init
   - Validate script functionality
   - Test command implementations

4. **Clean Operations**:
   - Regenerate inclaude.md when docs change
   - Update skel/ when skeleton changes
   - No template management needed

**Integration Points**:

**Makefile Integration**:

```makefile
build:          ## Build runtime artifacts from sources
build-clean:    ## Clean build artifacts and rebuild from sources
build-check:    ## Validate build artifacts integrity
build-lint:     ## Lint generated Markdown files in build artifacts
build-test:     ## Test runtime functionality after build
clean:          ## Clean all build artifacts (skel/, templates/ in .claude/doh/)
```

**Development Workflow**:

1. Edit source files (`./skel/config.ini`, `./templates/epic_template.md`)
2. Run `make build` to sync to runtime (copy files + any generation)
3. Run `make build-lint` to lint Claude-generated Markdown (if any)
4. Test with `/doh:init` and DOH agents using built artifacts
5. Commit source files (not build artifacts)
6. Run `make clean` to remove build artifacts if needed

**Clean Process**:

```makefile
clean:  ## Clean build artifacts safely
 @echo "üßπ Cleaning DOH build artifacts..."
 @if [ -d ".claude/doh/skel" ]; then rm -rf .claude/doh/skel && echo "‚úÖ Removed .claude/doh/skel/"; fi
 @if [ -d ".claude/doh/templates" ]; then rm -rf .claude/doh/templates && echo "‚úÖ Removed .claude/doh/templates/"; fi
 @echo "üîí Preserved: scripts/, inclaude.md"
```

**Clean Safety**:

- Only removes build artifacts (skel/, templates/)
- Preserves essential runtime (scripts/, inclaude.md)
- Validates source files exist before cleaning
- Can be run safely multiple times

**Build Linting Process**:

```makefile
build-lint:  ## Lint Claude-generated Markdown in build artifacts
 @echo "üìù Linting Claude-generated Markdown..."
 # Only lint files that are GENERATED by Claude during build, not copied files
 # Example: if inclaude.md is generated from templates
 @if [ -f ".claude/doh/inclaude.md" ] && [ -f ".claude/doh/.generated" ]; then \
  npx markdownlint .claude/doh/inclaude.md; fi
 @echo "‚úÖ Generated artifacts linted"
```

**Linting Strategy**:

- **Generated files only**: Only lint Markdown that Claude creates during build process
- **Skip copied files**: Simple cp operations don't need linting (source already linted)
- **Detection mechanism**: Use marker files or timestamps to detect generated content
- **Key use case**: If inclaude.md or other files are dynamically generated from templates
- **Smart approach**: No unnecessary linting of identical copied content

**Distribution Model**:

- Package only `.claude/doh/` directory for distribution
- Source files (`./skel/`, `./docs/`) not included in end-user packages
- Self-contained runtime with all dependencies

**Tasks**:

- [ ] **Design build system architecture**: Source ‚Üí Runtime artifact mapping (skel/, templates/)
- [ ] **Implement Makefile build targets**: build, build-clean, build-check, build-lint, build-test, clean
- [ ] **Add change detection**: Only build when sources change (timestamp/checksum based)
- [ ] **Create build validation**: Verify runtime artifacts integrity and completeness
- [ ] **Implement markdown linting**: Lint generated .md files in build artifacts (T027 integration)
- [ ] **Implement clean process**: Safe removal of build artifacts (.claude/doh/skel/, .claude/doh/templates/) with
      validation
- [ ] **Integration with dev workflow**: Seamless source ‚Üí build ‚Üí lint ‚Üí test cycle
- [ ] **Update .gitignore**: Exclude build artifacts from git (if needed)
- [ ] **Distribution packaging**: Script to package runtime-only for distribution
- [ ] **Documentation**: Build process guide for contributors (build/clean/lint commands)
- [ ] **CI/CD integration**: Automated build validation in T024 testing framework
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: Fast incremental builds with smart caching

**Build System Options to Consider**:

**Option A: Make-based**:

- ‚úÖ Universal, simple, existing Makefile integration
- ‚úÖ Familiar to developers
- ‚ùå Limited change detection

**Option B: npm scripts**:

- ‚úÖ Good change detection with tools
- ‚úÖ Rich ecosystem
- ‚ùå Adds Node.js dependency to build

**Option C: Custom bash**:

- ‚úÖ DOH-native, no external deps
- ‚úÖ Full control
- ‚ùå More implementation work

**Option D: Hybrid (Make + bash utilities)**:

- ‚úÖ Best of both worlds
- ‚úÖ Leverages existing infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Extensible

**Decision Criteria**:

- **Simplicity**: Easy for contributors to understand and use
- **Performance**: Fast incremental builds for development
- **Reliability**: Consistent build results across environments
- **Integration**: Works with existing T028 dev environment
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external tool requirements

**Deliverable**: Complete build system design and implementation that maintains Single Source of Truth while providing
reliable runtime artifacts for DOH distribution and testing.

### T033 - Restore skel/ and templates/ to .claude/doh/ runtime directory üö©

**Status**: COMPLETED ‚úÖ  
**Priority**: Medium - Runtime functionality  
**Dependencies**: None - Direct action  
**Version**: 1.4.0 ‚úÖ **Completed**: 2025-08-27

Restore `skel/` and `templates/` directories to `.claude/doh/` to ensure proper runtime access for DOH commands and
`/doh:init` functionality, including cleanup of obsolete/useless templates and skeleton files.

**Implementation Completed**:

‚úÖ **Templates restored to runtime**:

- Copied `./templates/` ‚Üí `.claude/doh/templates/`
- All 4 template files accessible: epic_template.md, feature_template.md, prd_template.md, task_template.md

‚úÖ **Skeleton updated and synchronized**:

- Synced `./skel/` ‚Üí `.claude/doh/skel/` with latest source files
- Fixed formatting differences from prettier auto-correction
- Removed obsolete files and updated paths

‚úÖ **Runtime functionality validated**:

- `/doh:init` script accessible and working with skeleton files
- All skeleton files have proper permissions (644)
- DOH commands can access templates for runtime operations
- All runtime dependencies satisfied

**Final Architecture**:

```text
# Development Sources (Single Source of Truth)
./skel/           # Master skeleton files
./templates/      # Master templates
./docs/           # Master documentation

# Runtime Distribution (.claude/doh/) - 25 files total
.claude/doh/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/      # Runtime scripts (100% bash + jq + awk)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ skel/         # Runtime skeleton files (copy of ./skel/)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/    # Runtime templates (copy of ./templates/)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inclaude.md   # Generated runtime guide
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [libs & bins] # Supporting runtime components
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è ARCHITECTURE DEPRECATION (2025-08-27)**: The "controlled duplication" strategy documented above was **deprecated**
and replaced with **single source of truth** approach. The project root `./skel/` and `./templates/` folders were
**removed** - they now exist **only** in `.claude/doh/` to eliminate duplication and maintenance overhead.

**Cleanup Actions Performed**:

‚úÖ **Obsolete file cleanup**:

- Updated test-deployment.sh with correct paths
- Synchronized epic0.md formatting with source
- Removed outdated template references
- Fixed path inconsistencies in skeleton files

‚úÖ **Template consolidation**:

- Verified all 4 templates are current and functional
- Removed any duplicate or obsolete template files
- Ensured template accessibility for DOH agents

**Validation Results**:

- [x] `/doh:init` functionality works with complete skeleton
- [x] DOH commands can access all templates
- [x] Skeleton files complete and functional
- [x] No runtime dependencies missing
