### T001 - DOH Skeleton Implementation & Methodology Enforcement üö©üö©

**Status**: Ready to implement  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Blocks T002 development and methodology enforcement  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Target Version**: 1.4.0

Create standardized `.doh/` skeleton structure that enforces strict DOH project management methodology and enables
memory context for all `/doh` commands. The skeleton serves as the foundation for methodology compliance and intelligent
project context.

**Impact**: Currently `/doh:init` and `/doh:analyze` lack standard templates, causing inconsistent .doh setups and
preventing proper DOH methodology enforcement. Without skeleton structure, `/doh` commands cannot maintain memory
context or enforce disciplined project management workflow vs free-form Claude interactions.

**Core Architecture Requirements**:

**DOH Methodology Enforcement**:

- **Structural Discipline**: Enforces PRD ‚Üí Epic ‚Üí Feature ‚Üí Task hierarchy
- **Process Compliance**: All `/doh` commands must follow DOH workflow standards
- **Traceability Mandates**: Every work item connects to business objectives
- **Memory Context**: Persistent project intelligence vs ephemeral Claude interactions
- **Workflow Guidance**: Built-in methodology coaching and compliance checking

**Memory Context Foundation**:

- **Project Persistence**: Commands build on accumulated project knowledge
- **Decision Tracking**: Memory system preserves rationale and context
- **Session Continuity**: Command interactions maintain state across time

#### Phase 4: Command Integration (2h)

- [ ] **Update `/doh:init` command** to use skeleton with methodology enforcement
- [ ] **Add methodology compliance validation** to skeleton deployment
- [ ] **Create migration strategy** for existing `.doh/` projects
- [ ] **Build methodology coaching features** into command responses

#### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (1.5h)

- [ ] **Test skeleton deployment** on new projects with methodology validation
- [ ] **Validate memory context loading** across multiple command sessions
- [ ] **Test methodology enforcement** with various command scenarios
- [ ] **Verify backward compatibility** with existing DOH projects

#### Phase 6: Documentation & Integration (1h)

- [ ] **Update command documentation** to reflect methodology enforcement
- [ ] **Create skeleton usage guide** with DOH workflow examples
- [ ] **Document memory context architecture** for future development

**Methodology Compliance Features**:

**Structural Enforcement**:

- All tasks MUST belong to an epic (Epic #0 or dedicated epic)
- All epics MUST follow DOH template structure with proper documentation
- All features MUST connect to epics and contain structured task breakdown
- Project structure MUST maintain proper hierarchy and traceability

**Process Enforcement**:

- Status transitions MUST follow DOH workflow (PROPOSED ‚Üí IN PROGRESS ‚Üí COMPLETED)
- Task completion MUST update epic progress and memory context
- Epic graduation MUST be suggested when Epic #0 exceeds threshold
- Memory context MUST be updated with every significant project decision

**Quality Assurance**:

- Templates MUST include methodology guidance and examples
- Validation MUST check for proper DOH structure compliance
- Memory system MUST preserve decision rationale and project evolution
- Commands MUST provide methodology coaching when structure issues detected

**Performance Targets**:

- Skeleton deployment: <5 seconds for complete project initialization
- Memory context loading: <200ms for typical project state
- Methodology validation: <100ms for structure compliance checking
- Command execution: Context-aware responses within standard performance limits

**Success Criteria**:

- All `/doh` commands enforce strict methodology compliance
- Memory context provides persistent project intelligence across sessions
- Skeleton enables consistent DOH project structure across all users
- Methodology coaching guides users toward best practices automatically
- Template structure scales from personal projects to team collaboration

**Deliverable**: Complete DOH skeleton system with methodology enforcement, memory context architecture, and integrated
command foundation that transforms `/doh` commands into disciplined project management workflow vs free-form
interactions.

### T030 - Fix Single Source of Truth violations in CLAUDE.md after T026 completion

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Priority**: HIGH - Critical for 1.4.0 release consistency  
**Dependencies**: T026 (restructuring completion ‚úÖ), T034 (analysis completed ‚úÖ)  
**Version**: 1.4.0 **Tags**: `#doc` **Analysis**: Part of `analysis/T034-documentation-health-report.md`

Fix Single Source of Truth violations in CLAUDE.md and execute critical architecture reference cleanup identified by
T034 comprehensive documentation audit. This is now a critical 1.4.0 blocker due to 89 outdated architecture references
found.

**Impact**: T034 analysis revealed critical issues beyond CLAUDE.md - 89 outdated architecture references across 15
files create user confusion and command failures. This expanded scope makes it a 1.4.0 release blocker.

**Critical Issues Identified by T034**:

1. **Architecture References (89 total across 15 files)**:
   - "skel/" references: 47 occurrences
   - "templates/" references: 31 occurrences
   - "controlled duplication": 11 occurrences
   - Files: CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/architecture.md, TODO.md, TODOARCHIVED.md, .claude/commands/doh/init.md, others

2. **Version Inconsistencies**:
   - JSON examples using "version": "1.0.0" instead of "1.4.0"
   - Mixed version references across documentation
   - Files: docs/architecture.md:112, analysis/T014-data-structure-analysis.md:39, .claude/commands/doh/agent.md:392

3. **Most Critical Files (per T034)**:
   - CONTRIBUTING.md:90 - Shows old project structure with `skel/`
   - docs/architecture.md:30,34 - References `.claude/doh/templates/`
   - .claude/commands/doh/init.md:216-217 - References old structure

4. **Impact Assessment**:
   - User confusion from inconsistent structure information
   - Command failures from references to non-existent paths
   - Maintenance burden from multiple sources of truth
   - Risk of information drift and inconsistency

**Tasks (T034 Phase 1 - Critical Architecture Cleanup)**:

**High Priority (1.4.0 Blockers)**:

- [ ] **CONTRIBUTING.md:90** - Fix project structure section showing old `skel/` structure
- [ ] **docs/architecture.md:30,34** - Remove references to `.claude/doh/templates/`
- [ ] **CLAUDE.md** - Remove outdated DOH system structure and duplicated planning sections
- [ ] **.claude/commands/doh/init.md:216-217** - Update structure references
- [ ] **Version consistency** - Update JSON examples from "1.0.0" to "1.4.0" in 3 files

**Medium Priority (Quality)**:

- [ ] **TODO.md architecture sections** - Add deprecation notices to old strategy references
- [ ] **TODOARCHIVED.md** - Add clear deprecation notices for controlled duplication strategy
- [ ] **Cross-reference audit** - Scan remaining 10 files with architecture references
- [ ] **Navigation improvements** - Add document map to README.md per T034 recommendations

**Proposed CLAUDE.md Changes**:

Replace sections with:

```markdown
## DOH System Structure

üìÅ **Current Structure**: See `TODO.md` T026 for complete system organization and migration status.

## Task Management

This project uses traditional TODO.md (in project root) for development tasks rather than the /doh system it provides to
other projects.

üìã **Version Management Rules**: See `TODO.md` section "TODO Management" üìÅ **System Structure**: See `TODO.md` T026 for
current organization
```

**Single Source of Truth Enforcement**:

- TODO.md = Source of truth for development tasks, planning, and system structure
- CLAUDE.md = Configuration and brief references only
- No duplication of detailed information between files

**Benefits**:

- Single maintenance point for system structure
- No risk of information drift between files
- Cleaner CLAUDE.md focused on configuration
- Easier updates when structure evolves

**Deliverable**: CLAUDE.md with all Single Source of Truth violations fixed, containing only brief references to TODO.md
for detailed information, ensuring no duplication of system structure or planning details.

### T032 - Design DOH Runtime Build Process (.claude/doh/ as build directory)

**Status**: ACTIVE - Ready for implementation  
**Priority**: Medium - Build system architecture  
**Dependencies**: T031 (architecture decision)  
**Proposed Version**: 1.4.0

Design and implement build process for DOH runtime where `.claude/doh/` contains all runtime components.

**Impact**: Architecture updated - `.claude/doh/` now contains the single source of truth for skel/ and templates/ (no
duplication in project root). Build process focuses on inclaude.md generation from docs/ and maintaining runtime
integrity.

#### Critical Focus: Stable inclaude.md Generation Strategy

For stable version-to-version builds with clean diffs:

**inclaude.md Generation Process**:

1. **Source Analysis**: Read current inclaude.md structure and style
2. **Documentation Mining**: Extract updates from docs/commands.md, docs/architecture.md, WORKFLOW.md
3. **Template Consistency**: Maintain existing sections and formatting patterns
4. **Stable Output**: Ensure deterministic generation (no timestamps, consistent ordering)
5. **Diff Optimization**: Only modify sections that actually changed

**Key Sources for inclaude.md**:

- `docs/commands.md` - Command specifications and natural language usage
- `docs/architecture.md` - Structure, IDs, file organization
- `WORKFLOW.md` - Quick workflow examples
- `.claude/doh/scripts/` - Available runtime commands
- `.claude/commands/` - Claude command implementations and behavior
- `templates/` - Template structure information

**Generation Strategy**:

- Parse existing inclaude.md sections as stable baseline
- Identify which docs sections map to which inclaude.md sections
- Update only changed content, preserve structure and style
- Maintain 2KB optimization target for Claude performance
- Validate generated content matches expected format

**Enhanced Design Questions**:

1. What triggers builds? (version changes, manual, CI/CD)
2. How to validate runtime artifact quality?
3. Should `.claude/doh/` be git-ignored as build output?
4. How to maintain backward compatibility during builds?
5. Which components have been most useful for creating inclaude.md historically?
6. How to ensure deterministic, diff-friendly generation of inclaude.md?

**Revised Architecture Model**:

```text
# Documentation Sources (Project Root)
./docs/                    # Documentation only
./analysis/                # Analysis documents only

# Runtime & Development (.claude/doh/)
.claude/doh/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/               # Runtime scripts (100% bash)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ skel/                  # Skeleton files (single source)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/             # Template files (single source)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inclaude.md           # Generated runtime guide
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/commands/doh/ # Command implementations
```

**Simplified Build Process**:

1. **No Duplication**: skel/ and templates/ exist only in `.claude/doh/` (single source of truth)

2. **Focus on inclaude.md Generation**:
   - Generate optimized inclaude.md from docs/ sources
   - Maintain skel/ and templates/ directly in .claude/doh/
   - No copying needed for runtime functionality

3. **Build Validation**:
   - Verify inclaude.md generation quality
   - Check skel/ integrity for /doh:init
   - Validate script functionality
   - Test command implementations

4. **Clean Operations**:
   - Regenerate inclaude.md when docs change
   - Update skel/ when skeleton changes
   - No template management needed

**Integration Points**:

**Makefile Integration**:

```makefile
build:          ## Build runtime artifacts from sources
build-clean:    ## Clean build artifacts and rebuild from sources
build-check:    ## Validate build artifacts integrity
build-lint:     ## Lint generated Markdown files in build artifacts
build-test:     ## Test runtime functionality after build
clean:          ## Clean all build artifacts (skel/, templates/ in .claude/doh/)
```

**Development Workflow**:

1. Edit source files (`./skel/config.ini`, `./templates/epic_template.md`)
2. Run `make build` to sync to runtime (copy files + any generation)
3. Run `make build-lint` to lint Claude-generated Markdown (if any)
4. Test with `/doh:init` and DOH agents using built artifacts
5. Commit source files (not build artifacts)
6. Run `make clean` to remove build artifacts if needed

**Clean Process**:

```makefile
clean:  ## Clean build artifacts safely
 @echo "üßπ Cleaning DOH build artifacts..."
 @if [ -d ".claude/doh/skel" ]; then rm -rf .claude/doh/skel && echo "‚úÖ Removed .claude/doh/skel/"; fi
 @if [ -d ".claude/doh/templates" ]; then rm -rf .claude/doh/templates && echo "‚úÖ Removed .claude/doh/templates/"; fi
 @echo "üîí Preserved: scripts/, inclaude.md"
```

**Clean Safety**:

- Only removes build artifacts (skel/, templates/)
- Preserves essential runtime (scripts/, inclaude.md)
- Validates source files exist before cleaning
- Can be run safely multiple times

**Build Linting Process**:

```makefile
build-lint:  ## Lint Claude-generated Markdown in build artifacts
 @echo "üìù Linting Claude-generated Markdown..."
 # Only lint files that are GENERATED by Claude during build, not copied files
 # Example: if inclaude.md is generated from templates
 @if [ -f ".claude/doh/inclaude.md" ] && [ -f ".claude/doh/.generated" ]; then \
  npx markdownlint .claude/doh/inclaude.md; fi
 @echo "‚úÖ Generated artifacts linted"
```

**Linting Strategy**:

- **Generated files only**: Only lint Markdown that Claude creates during build process
- **Skip copied files**: Simple cp operations don't need linting (source already linted)
- **Detection mechanism**: Use marker files or timestamps to detect generated content
- **Key use case**: If inclaude.md or other files are dynamically generated from templates
- **Smart approach**: No unnecessary linting of identical copied content

**Distribution Model**:

- Package only `.claude/doh/` directory for distribution
- Source files (`./skel/`, `./docs/`) not included in end-user packages
- Self-contained runtime with all dependencies

**Tasks**:

- [ ] **Design build system architecture**: Source ‚Üí Runtime artifact mapping (skel/, templates/)
- [ ] **Implement Makefile build targets**: build, build-clean, build-check, build-lint, build-test, clean
- [ ] **Add change detection**: Only build when sources change (timestamp/checksum based)
- [ ] **Create build validation**: Verify runtime artifacts integrity and completeness
- [ ] **Implement markdown linting**: Lint generated .md files in build artifacts (T027 integration)
- [ ] **Implement clean process**: Safe removal of build artifacts (.claude/doh/skel/, .claude/doh/templates/) with
      validation
- [ ] **Integration with dev workflow**: Seamless source ‚Üí build ‚Üí lint ‚Üí test cycle
- [ ] **Update .gitignore**: Exclude build artifacts from git (if needed)
- [ ] **Distribution packaging**: Script to package runtime-only for distribution
- [ ] **Documentation**: Build process guide for contributors (build/clean/lint commands)
- [ ] **CI/CD integration**: Automated build validation in T024 testing framework
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: Fast incremental builds with smart caching

**Build System Options to Consider**:

**Option A: Make-based**:

- ‚úÖ Universal, simple, existing Makefile integration
- ‚úÖ Familiar to developers
- ‚ùå Limited change detection

**Option B: npm scripts**:

- ‚úÖ Good change detection with tools
- ‚úÖ Rich ecosystem
- ‚ùå Adds Node.js dependency to build

**Option C: Custom bash**:

- ‚úÖ DOH-native, no external deps
- ‚úÖ Full control
- ‚ùå More implementation work

**Option D: Hybrid (Make + bash utilities)**:

- ‚úÖ Best of both worlds
- ‚úÖ Leverages existing infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Extensible

**Decision Criteria**:

- **Simplicity**: Easy for contributors to understand and use
- **Performance**: Fast incremental builds for development
- **Reliability**: Consistent build results across environments
- **Integration**: Works with existing T028 dev environment
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external tool requirements

**Deliverable**: Complete build system design and implementation that maintains Single Source of Truth while providing
reliable runtime artifacts for DOH distribution and testing.

### T033 - Restore skel/ and templates/ to .claude/doh/ runtime directory üö©

**Status**: COMPLETED ‚úÖ  
**Priority**: Medium - Runtime functionality  
**Dependencies**: None - Direct action  
**Version**: 1.4.0 ‚úÖ **Completed**: 2025-08-27

Restore `skel/` and `templates/` directories to `.claude/doh/` to ensure proper runtime access for DOH commands and
`/doh:init` functionality, including cleanup of obsolete/useless templates and skeleton files.

**Implementation Completed**:

‚úÖ **Templates restored to runtime**:

- Copied `./templates/` ‚Üí `.claude/doh/templates/`
- All 4 template files accessible: epic_template.md, feature_template.md, prd_template.md, task_template.md

‚úÖ **Skeleton updated and synchronized**:

- Synced `./skel/` ‚Üí `.claude/doh/skel/` with latest source files
- Fixed formatting differences from prettier auto-correction
- Removed obsolete files and updated paths

‚úÖ **Runtime functionality validated**:

- `/doh:init` script accessible and working with skeleton files
- All skeleton files have proper permissions (644)
- DOH commands can access templates for runtime operations
- All runtime dependencies satisfied

**Final Architecture**:

```text
# Development Sources (Single Source of Truth)
./skel/           # Master skeleton files
./templates/      # Master templates
./docs/           # Master documentation

# Runtime Distribution (.claude/doh/) - 25 files total
.claude/doh/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/      # Runtime scripts (100% bash + jq + awk)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ skel/         # Runtime skeleton files (copy of ./skel/)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/    # Runtime templates (copy of ./templates/)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inclaude.md   # Generated runtime guide
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [libs & bins] # Supporting runtime components
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è ARCHITECTURE DEPRECATION (2025-08-27)**: The "controlled duplication" strategy documented above was **deprecated**
and replaced with **single source of truth** approach. The project root `./skel/` and `./templates/` folders were
**removed** - they now exist **only** in `.claude/doh/` to eliminate duplication and maintenance overhead.

**Cleanup Actions Performed**:

‚úÖ **Obsolete file cleanup**:

- Updated test-deployment.sh with correct paths
- Synchronized epic0.md formatting with source
- Removed outdated template references
- Fixed path inconsistencies in skeleton files

‚úÖ **Template consolidation**:

### T034 - Documentation Health Check & Content Review

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Priority**: Medium - Comprehensive documentation audit  
**Dependencies**: None (can be done independently), T030 (cross-check coordination)  
**Version**: 1.4.0 **Tags**: `#think` **Analysis**: `analysis/T034-documentation-health-report.md`

Conduct comprehensive brainstorming and health check of all project documentation to ensure content is useful,
well-balanced, up-to-date, and eliminates redundancy or outdated information after the recent architecture changes.

**Impact**: Recent architectural changes (T026 restructuring, T033 single source strategy) may have created
documentation inconsistencies, outdated references, or gaps. A systematic review ensures all documentation serves its
purpose and guides users/developers effectively.

**Cross-Check Coordination with T030**: This task works in coordination with T030 (CLAUDE.md cleanup) to ensure
comprehensive documentation health. T034 provides the broader audit while T030 handles specific CLAUDE.md fixes. Both
tasks should be completed together for maximum effectiveness.

**Scope of Review**:

**Project Root Documentation**:

- `README.md` - Project overview and quick start
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Feature tracking and version history
- `VERSION.md` - Version management
- `WORKFLOW.md` - User workflow guide
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI/development configuration
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Developer guidelines
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guide

**Documentation Directories**:

- `docs/` - Technical documentation (12 files)
- `analysis/` - Development analysis (2 files)
- `.claude/doh/inclaude.md` - Runtime documentation

**Brainstorming Questions**:

**Content Usefulness**:

- Which documents provide immediate value to users vs developers?
- Are there documents that duplicate information?
- What gaps exist for new contributors or users?
- Which files are actually referenced/used vs ignored?

**Balance Assessment**:

- Is there too much technical detail in user-facing docs?
- Are developer docs comprehensive enough?
- Do we have the right mix of guides vs reference material?
- Are examples practical and current?

**Currency Check**:

- Which documents reference old architecture (./skel/, ./templates/)?
- Are all version references accurate (1.4.0 target)?
- Do workflow examples match current command structure?
- Are dependency lists current (Node.js versions, tool versions)?

**Structural Review**:

- Should some docs be merged or split?
- Are docs in the right directories?
- Do navigation and cross-references work?
- Is the information hierarchy logical?

**Tasks**:

- "Show me quick wins I can finish today"
- "What's ready to start that doesn't depend on other work?"
- "Give me a summary of this week's progress"

**Contextual Commands**:

- "Add three tasks for user registration: validation, database, and email confirmation"
- "Move all the CSS cleanup tasks to a new maintenance epic"
- "Mark the authentication epic as complete and archive it"

**Success Criteria**:

- Natural language processing accurately interprets 90% of common project management expressions
- Performance degradation <20% compared to direct command execution
- Seamless fallback to existing syntax when natural language parsing fails
- Context awareness improves command accuracy across conversation sessions
- User satisfaction significantly higher with natural language interface

**Performance Targets**:

- Simple NL commands (create, update): <200ms processing time
- Complex NL queries (analysis, reporting): <2s processing time
- Context retention across 50+ command session
- Cache hit rate >80% for common language patterns
- Memory footprint <50MB for context and caching

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive natural language interface design document
(`analysis/T044-natural-language-doh-interface.md`) with technical architecture, performance optimization strategies,
implementation roadmap, and user experience design for conversational DOH command interaction.
