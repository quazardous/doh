#### **ML Model Architecture**

**Multi-Model Ensemble Approach:**

**1. Collaborative Filtering Model**
- **Algorithm**: Matrix Factorization (ALS) or Neural Collaborative Filtering
- **Purpose**: User-item interaction patterns for personalized recommendations
- **Strengths**: Excellent for users with purchase history
- **Limitations**: Cold start problem for new users/products

**2. Content-Based Filtering Model**
- **Algorithm**: TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity or Deep Content Embeddings
- **Purpose**: Product similarity based on features, descriptions, categories
- **Strengths**: Handles new products well, explainable recommendations
- **Limitations**: Limited by product metadata quality

**3. Deep Learning Model**
- **Algorithm**: Wide & Deep Learning or Deep & Cross Network
- **Purpose**: Complex feature interactions and non-linear patterns
- **Strengths**: Captures complex user-product relationships
- **Limitations**: Less interpretable, requires significant data

**4. Session-Based Model**
- **Algorithm**: Recurrent Neural Networks (GRU/LSTM) or Transformer
- **Purpose**: Real-time recommendations based on current session behavior
- **Strengths**: Immediate response to user actions
- **Limitations**: Limited long-term user understanding

#### **Cold Start Strategy**

**New User Cold Start:**
1. **Demographic-Based**: Recommendations based on age, location, device type
2. **Popular Items**: Trending and best-selling products as initial suggestions
3. **Category Exploration**: Diverse product categories to learn preferences quickly
4. **Onboarding Flow**: Optional preference selection during account creation
5. **Rapid Learning**: Update recommendations after minimal interactions (3-5 items)

**New Product Cold Start:**
1. **Content-Based Similarity**: Recommend to users who purchased similar products
2. **Category-Based**: Show to users active in same product category
3. **Feature Matching**: Match product attributes to user preferences
4. **Expert Curation**: Manual promotion for strategically important new products
5. **Social Proof**: Leverage external signals (social media, reviews) when available

#### **Privacy and Compliance Framework**

- **Right to Deletion**: Remove user data and retrain models upon request

**Privacy-Preserving Techniques:**
- **Differential Privacy**: Add noise to training data to protect individual privacy
- **Federated Learning**: Train models locally on user devices where possible
- **Data Anonymization**: Remove personally identifiable information from training data
- **Secure Aggregation**: Aggregate user behaviors without exposing individual patterns

#### **Explainable AI Implementation**

**Recommendation Explanations:**
1. **Similar Users**: "Users like you also purchased..."
2. **Product Similarity**: "Because you bought X, you might like Y..."
3. **Category Interest**: "Based on your interest in [category]..."
