#### **Zero-Downtime Migration Architecture**

**Data Synchronization Strategy:**

**Bi-Directional Data Sync:**
```
Phase 1: Read-Only Component
├── Legacy PHP: 100% writes, 100% reads
├── New Component: 0% writes, 0% reads
├── Data Sync: Real-time replication Legacy → Component
└── Validation: Shadow testing with production data

Phase 2: Read Migration
├── Legacy PHP: 100% writes, 90% reads
├── New Component: 0% writes, 10% reads
├── Data Sync: Bi-directional real-time sync
└── Monitoring: Compare response times and data accuracy

Phase 3: Write Migration
├── Legacy PHP: 90% writes, 50% reads  
├── New Component: 10% writes, 50% reads
├── Data Sync: Bi-directional with conflict resolution
└── Rollback: Instant fallback on any data inconsistency

Phase 4: Full Migration
├── Legacy PHP: 0% writes, 0% reads
├── New Component: 100% writes, 100% reads
├── Data Sync: One-way Legacy → Component (historical data)
└── Decommission: Legacy component graceful shutdown
```

**Technology Stack for Components:**
- **Runtime**: Node.js/TypeScript for performance and maintainability
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data + Redis for caching
- **API Layer**: GraphQL federation for component composition
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka for event-driven component communication

#### **Component-by-Component Migration Plan**

**Component 1: User Management (Weeks 1-12)**

**Business Justification**: Foundational component with clear boundaries, lowest revenue risk

**Technical Scope:**
- User authentication and session management
- User profiles, preferences, and account settings  
- Password reset, account creation, profile updates

**Migration Strategy:**
```
Week 1-4: Data Analysis and Reverse Engineering
├── Extract user-related tables from 200+ table schema
├── Document PHP authentication logic and session handling
├── Identify stored procedures affecting user operations
└── Map user data relationships and dependencies

Week 5-8: Component Development and Data Sync
├── Build Node.js user management component
├── Implement bi-directional data synchronization
├── Create API compatibility layer for existing PHP calls
└── Comprehensive testing with production data copy

Week 9-12: Traffic Migration and Validation
├── Deploy shadow testing (0% traffic, full data sync)
├── Gradual traffic migration: 1% → 5% → 25% → 100%
├── Performance monitoring and rollback procedures
└── Legacy user code cleanup and archival
```

**Component 2: Product Catalog (Weeks 8-20)**

**Business Justification**: Product browsing and search critical for conversion, clear component boundaries

**Technical Scope:**
- Product catalog, categories, and search functionality
- Inventory management and pricing
- Product images, descriptions, and metadata

**Migration Challenges:**
- Product search performance must match or exceed legacy system
- Inventory accuracy critical for order fulfillment
- Product pricing logic embedded in stored procedures

**Component 3: Shopping Cart & Checkout (Weeks 16-32)**

**Business Justification**: Revenue-critical component requiring maximum safety measures

**Technical Scope:**
- Shopping cart management and persistence
- Checkout process, payment handling, tax calculation
- Order creation and initial fulfillment

**High-Risk Considerations:**
- Checkout abandonment if performance degrades
- Payment processing integration with existing providers
- Tax calculation accuracy for regulatory compliance

**Component 4: Order Management (Weeks 24-40)**

**Business Justification**: Complex business logic requiring careful extraction

**Technical Scope:**
- Order status tracking and updates
- Fulfillment workflow and shipping integration
- Customer service tools and order modifications

**Migration Complexity:**
- Order state machine logic embedded throughout legacy system
- Integration with external shipping and logistics providers
- Customer service team workflow continuity

#### **Data Migration and Synchronization**

**Real-Time Data Sync Implementation:**

**Database Change Capture:**
```sql
-- MySQL Binlog-based Change Data Capture
1. Enable MySQL binary logging for all user tables
2. Kafka Connect MySQL Source connector for change streaming
3. Kafka topics per table with partition keys for ordering
4. Component-specific Kafka consumers for data synchronization
```

**Conflict Resolution Strategy:**
1. **Timestamp-based**: Most recent change wins (acceptable for user profile data)
2. **Business Logic**: Application-specific conflict resolution (order totals, inventory)
3. **Manual Review**: Queue conflicting changes for administrator review
4. **Rollback Trigger**: Automatic rollback if conflict rate exceeds threshold

**Data Consistency Validation:**
```javascript
// Automated Data Consistency Checking
setInterval(async () => {
  const legacyData = await legacyDB.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE updated_at > ?', lastCheck);
  const componentData = await componentDB.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE updated_at > ?', lastCheck);
  
  const inconsistencies = compareDatasets(legacyData, componentData);
  if (inconsistencies.length > THRESHOLD) {
    triggerAlert('Data inconsistency detected', inconsistencies);
    if (inconsistencies.length > CRITICAL_THRESHOLD) {
      triggerRollback('Critical data inconsistency - rolling back');
    }
  }
}, 30000); // Check every 30 seconds
```

#### **Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategy**

**Blue-Green Deployment with Canary Release:**

**Deployment Infrastructure:**
```
┌─────────────────┐    Intelligent    ┌──────────────────┐
│     Users       │    Load Balancer  │  Component       │
│   (10K+)        │◄─────────────────►│  Deployment      │
└─────────────────┘                   └──────────────────┘
                                               │
                        ┌──────────────────────┼──────────────────────┐
                        ▼                      ▼                      ▼
              ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
              │     Blue        │    │     Green       │    │    Legacy       │
              │  Environment    │    │  Environment    │    │   PHP System    │
              │  (Current)      │    │   (New)         │    │   (Fallback)    │
              └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

**Traffic Routing Strategy:**
1. **0% New Traffic**: New component receives replicated data, no user traffic
2. **1% Canary**: Route 1% of traffic to new component, monitor all metrics
3. **5% Validation**: Increase to 5% if all metrics remain stable
4. **25% Confidence**: Scale to 25% with automated rollback triggers
5. **100% Migration**: Full traffic migration with legacy system on standby

**Rollback Procedures:**
- **Instant Rollback**: <30 seconds to redirect all traffic to legacy system
- **Automated Triggers**: Revenue drop >2%, error rate >0.5%, latency >2x baseline
- **Manual Override**: Operations team can trigger immediate rollback
- **Data Recovery**: Sync any new component data back to legacy system

#### **Performance and Monitoring**

**Critical Performance Metrics:**
```
Business Metrics (Auto-Rollback Triggers):
├── Revenue per minute: Must maintain >95% of baseline
├── Conversion rate: Must maintain >90% of baseline  
├── Cart abandonment: Must not exceed 110% of baseline
└── Customer complaints: Zero tolerance for functionality issues

Technical Metrics (Monitoring):
├── Response time: 95th percentile <2x legacy baseline
├── Error rate: <0.1% for all component operations
├── Database performance: Query times must match legacy
└── Data consistency: 99.99% accuracy between systems
```

**Monitoring Infrastructure:**
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Grafana dashboards for all critical metrics
- **Automated Alerting**: PagerDuty alerts for threshold violations
- **Business Intelligence**: Real-time revenue and conversion tracking
- **Customer Experience**: Synthetic user testing every 60 seconds
