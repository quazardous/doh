- Single-agent focused primarily on technical implementation concerns
- Result: More comprehensive requirements and fewer post-analysis surprises

**3. Risk Balance**
- Multi-agent assessed both business and technical risks in integrated fashion
- Single-agent strong on technical risks, weaker on business implications
- Result: More realistic risk assessment and mitigation strategies

**4. Implementation Clarity**
- Multi-agent provided user story mapping and business value per technical phase
- Single-agent focused on technical task breakdown without business context
- Result: Clearer implementation priorities and stakeholder communication

### **Single-Agent Consistent Advantages**

**1. Analysis Efficiency**
