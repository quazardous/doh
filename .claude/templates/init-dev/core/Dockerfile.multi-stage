# Multi-stage Dockerfile for cherry-picking framework-specific tools
# Adapted based on detected stack requirements

# Stage 1: Node.js tools (if frontend detected)
FROM node:20-alpine AS node-tools
RUN npm install -g yarn
# Tools are available at: /usr/local/bin/node, /usr/local/bin/npm, /usr/local/bin/yarn

# Stage 2: PHP tools (if PHP detected)
FROM composer:2 AS php-tools
# Composer is available at: /usr/bin/composer

# Stage 3: Python tools (if Python detected) 
FROM python:3.12-slim AS python-tools
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir pip-tools
# pip, pip-tools available in /usr/local/bin/

# Stage 4: Main application container
FROM {{BASE_IMAGE}}

# Install system dependencies (framework-specific)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    # Universal tools
    git \
    curl \
    unzip \
    zip \
    supervisor \
    sudo \
    # Framework-specific dependencies (AI-detected)
{{FRAMEWORK_DEPENDENCIES}} \

# Working directory

# @AI-Kitchen: SKIP - Framework-specific dependency installation handled post-build
# Dependencies are installed via make dev-setup after container running
# This allows dynamic dependency management without rebuilding containers
{{DEPENDENCY_INSTALLATION}}

# @AI-Kitchen: SKIP - Do NOT copy application code during build
# Application code is mounted at runtime via docker-compose volumes
# This allows instant code changes without rebuilding containers
# Volume mount: .:/app (defined in docker-compose.yml)

# @AI-Kitchen: SKIP - Framework-specific permissions handled at runtime
# Volume mounted application will have proper permissions via UID/GID mapping
