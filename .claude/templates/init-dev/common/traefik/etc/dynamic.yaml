# HINT: If SSL certificates invalid → run 'make ssl-setup' to regenerate with mkcert
# HINT: If domains don't resolve → add '127.0.0.1 app.{{PROJECT_NAME}}.localhost' to /etc/hosts
# HINT: If Traefik not accessible → check ports {{EXTERNAL_TRAEFIK_PORT}}/{{EXTERNAL_HTTPS_PORT}} are free on host machine
# HINT: Certificate files must be in ./docker/traefik/certs/ directory
# HINT: Certificates generated with: mkcert "{{PROJECT_NAME}}.localhost" "*.{{PROJECT_NAME}}.localhost"
