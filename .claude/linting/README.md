# DD103 - Intelligent Linting Feedback System

**Complete learning system that proposes intelligent automation based on manual intervention patterns.**

## Core Philosophy

DD103 creates a feedback loop between manual linting corrections and automated improvements:

1. **Learn from manual interventions** - Every fix is logged with context
2. **Pattern recognition** - Identify recurring manual correction patterns  
3. **Intelligent proposals** - Suggest automation when patterns reach thresholds
4. **Human validation** - User approves or rejects proposed plugins
5. **Continuous improvement** - Rejected patterns continue with AI assistance

## System Components

### 1. Manual Intervention Logging (`manual-interventions.jsonl`)

JSONL format tracking every manual linting fix:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-29T12:00:00Z",
  "file": "docs/README.md", 
  "rule": "MD013",
  "original": "Very long line that exceeds limits...",
  "fixed": "Very long line that exceeds\nlimits...",
  "fix_type": "intelligent_line_break",
  "pattern": "long_line_with_conjunction", 
  "automation_potential": "high",
  "target_tool": "markdownlint",
  "reason": "Line too long, broken at conjunction for natural flow"
}
```

### 2. Pattern Analysis (`analyze-patterns.sh`)

Analyzes intervention patterns to identify automation opportunities:

```bash
# Analyze current patterns
.claude/linting/analyze-patterns.sh analyze

# Generate automation recommendations  
.claude/linting/analyze-patterns.sh recommend

# Calculate improvement metrics
.claude/linting/analyze-patterns.sh metrics

# Run comprehensive analysis
.claude/linting/analyze-patterns.sh all
```

### 3. Plugin Proposal System (`plugin-proposals.sh`)

Intelligent threshold-based plugin proposal system:

**Configuration:**
- `MIN_OCCURRENCES=5` - Minimum pattern occurrences to trigger proposal
- `HIGH_POTENTIAL_ONLY=true` - Only propose high automation potential patterns  
- `PROPOSAL_COOLDOWN=7` - Days between proposals for same pattern

**Commands:**
```bash
# Check for new proposals (automatic every 10 interventions)
.claude/linting/plugin-proposals.sh check

# Approve a proposal
.claude/linting/plugin-proposals.sh approve long_line_with_conjunction

# Reject a proposal with reason
.claude/linting/plugin-proposals.sh reject long_line_with_conjunction "Too complex"

# View approval/rejection status
.claude/linting/plugin-proposals.sh status
```

### 4. Main Integration (`smart-lint.sh`)

Central interface for the learning system:

```bash
# Interactive fix with learning
.claude/linting/smart-lint.sh fix docs/README.md markdownlint MD013

# Direct intervention logging
.claude/linting/smart-lint.sh log FILE TOOL RULE ORIGINAL FIXED FIX_TYPE PATTERN POTENTIAL REASON

# View learning statistics
.claude/linting/smart-lint.sh stats

# Check for plugin proposals
.claude/linting/smart-lint.sh check

# Approve/reject proposals
.claude/linting/smart-lint.sh approve PATTERN
.claude/linting/smart-lint.sh reject PATTERN "reason"

# Reset learning data (fresh start)
.claude/linting/smart-lint.sh reset
```

## Workflow Integration

### Manual Linting with Learning

When manual intervention is needed during linting:

1. **Run interactive fix:**
   ```bash
   .claude/linting/smart-lint.sh fix problematic-file.md markdownlint MD013
   ```

2. **System prompts for:**
   - Original problematic text
   - Fixed version  
   - Fix classification
   - Automation potential (high/medium/low)
   - Reason for fix

3. **Learning occurs automatically:**
   - Intervention logged to JSONL
   - Counter incremented
   - Every 10 interventions ‚Üí proposal check

### Plugin Proposal Lifecycle  

1. **Trigger:** Pattern reaches 5+ occurrences with high automation potential

2. **Proposal generated:**
   ```
   üîß PLUGIN PROPOSAL: long_line_with_conjunction
      Target tool: markdownlint
      Rule: MD013 violations  
      Occurrences: 7
      
   üìù Sample interventions:
      Original: Very long line with conjunction and more content...
      Fixed:    Very long line with conjunction\nand more content...
      Reason:   Line too long, broken at conjunction for natural flow
      
   üõ†Ô∏è  MARKDOWNLINT CUSTOM RULE PROPOSAL:
      Rule ID: MD-DOH-LONG-LINE-WITH-CONJUNCTION
      Pattern: long_line_with_conjunction
      Target: MD013 violations
      Evidence: 7 manual interventions
      
   ‚ùì APPROVAL REQUIRED:
      .claude/linting/plugin-proposals.sh approve long_line_with_conjunction
      .claude/linting/plugin-proposals.sh reject long_line_with_conjunction "reason"
   ```

3. **User decision:**
   - **Approve:** Plugin scheduled for development
   - **Reject:** Pattern logged, AI continues manual corrections

### Rejection Handling

When user rejects a proposal:

1. **Pattern marked as rejected** in `rejected-plugins.json`
2. **Never proposed again** - respects user decision
3. **AI continues manual corrections** for this pattern
4. **Clear feedback loop** - system learns user preferences

## Integration with DOH Linting

### Current Integration Points

The DD103 system integrates with the existing DOH linting infrastructure:

- **dev-tools/scripts/lint-files.sh** - Can call smart-lint.sh for learning
- **Pre-commit hooks** - Automatic intervention logging for repeated fixes
- **/dd:lint commands** - Enhanced with learning capabilities
- **DD089 exception handling** - Works with smart intervention logging

### Future Integration (VDD-0.2.0)

DD103 will be fully integrated into the unified linting backend established by DD087/DD088, providing:

- **Seamless learning** from all linting contexts (hooks, commands, manual)  
- **Zero-configuration automation** - proposals appear naturally during development
- **Professional polish** - intelligent system that improves over time

## Success Metrics

### Learning Effectiveness
