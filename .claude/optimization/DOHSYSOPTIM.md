## 🎯 Pattern Categories

As optimizations accumulate, they will be categorized by pattern types:

### Query Pattern Optimizations

- **Natural Language Processing** - Enhanced understanding of user intent
- **Context Matching** - Better correlation between queries and available options
- **Semantic Analysis** - Going beyond explicit tags to infer task relationships

### Execution Pattern Optimizations

- **Auto-Fix Improvements** - Enhanced automated correction capabilities
- **Priority Reordering** - Smarter sequencing of operations
- **Error Recovery** - Better handling of edge cases and failures

### User Preference Learning

- **Work Style Adaptation** - Learning individual developer patterns
- **Context Preference** - Understanding preferred task types and timing
- **Communication Style** - Adapting response formats to user preferences

### Cross-Command Intelligence

- **Shared Insights** - Optimizations that benefit multiple commands
- **Pipeline Integration** - Better coordination between command executions
- **State Management** - Improved handling of inter-command dependencies

---

## 📈 Success Tracking

### Metrics Monitored

- **Success Rate**: Percentage of executions that work without manual intervention
- **User Satisfaction**: Frequency of chosen vs. suggested recommendations
- **Efficiency Gains**: Reduction in manual fixes, retries, or corrections
- **Coverage Expansion**: New scenarios successfully handled after optimization

### Optimization Effectiveness

Each optimization will be tracked for:

- **Immediate Impact**: How it performed in the first few uses
- **Long-term Value**: Whether the improvement sustained over time
- **Side Effects**: Any unintended consequences or new issues introduced

---

## 🔍 Detection Triggers

### Automatic Pattern Recognition

- **Repetitive Issues** (3+ occurrences of same problem)
- **Manual Intervention Frequency** (>50% requiring user correction)
- **Query Miss Patterns** (consistent gaps in expected results)
- **Error Clustering** (multiple related failures)

### User Feedback Integration

- **Direct Suggestions**: When users explicitly request improvements
- **Behavioral Signals**: When user actions indicate current logic gaps
- **Performance Complaints**: When speed or accuracy issues are noted

---

## 🚀 Future Evolution

This system enables unlimited optimization discovery:

- **Emergent Intelligence**: New patterns will be discovered organically
- **Collaborative Learning**: User feedback drives continuous improvement
- **Cross-Project Insights**: Optimizations may apply across different DOH projects
- **Meta-Optimizations**: Optimizing the optimization detection process itself

---

## 💡 Contributing Optimizations

### Manual Optimization Requests

Users can suggest optimizations directly:

```bash
/doh-sys:[command] --suggest-optimization "description of desired improvement"
```

### Feedback Integration

All user corrections, manual edits, and alternative choices contribute to optimization detection algorithms.
