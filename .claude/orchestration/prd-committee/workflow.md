# PRD Committee Workflow

## Context Quality Guidelines

**Professional Team Assumption**: Committee analyzes assuming experienced development team by default.

**Resource Constraint Handling**:
- Intern/junior developer mentions ‚Üí Capture as "some [technology] knowledge available"
- Never let resource limitations drive architectural decisions
- Technical choices prioritize scalability, maintainability, best practices
- Resource constraints become implementation considerations, not design constraints

**If client explicitly wants resource accommodation**: They can intervene during checkpoints.

## Generic Workflow Algorithm

This workflow is designed to work with any number of rounds without modification.

### Core Algorithm
```python
def execute_committee_workflow(seed, manifest):
    """
    Execute N-round committee workflow based on manifest configuration.
    Fully reusable for any committee type.
    """
    # Initialize from manifest
    config = load_manifest(manifest)
    session = initialize_session(seed)
    
    # Round iteration
    round_num = 0
    converged = False
    
    while round_num < config.rounds.max and not converged:
        round_num += 1
        
        # Get round orientation and adjust agent priorities
        round_orientation = config.get_round_orientation(round_num)
        
        # Execute round phases with orientation-specific agent ordering
        for phase in config.rounds.phases_per_round:
            agents = get_agents_for_phase_with_orientation(
                phase=phase, 
                orientation=round_orientation,
                config=config

            )
        
        # Store round results
        session.save_round(round_num)
        
        # USER CHECKPOINT - Present brief and ask for corrections
        if config.user_checkpoints.enabled:
            user_intervention = present_round_brief_and_ask_corrections(
                session=session,
                round_num=round_num
            )
            
            # Apply user intervention if provided
            if user_intervention:
                apply_user_intervention(session, round_num, user_intervention)
        
        # Check convergence (if past minimum rounds)
        if round_num >= config.rounds.min:
            converged = check_convergence(session, round_num, config)
    
    # Final synthesis
    return create_final_deliverable(session, config)
```

## Phase Execution Patterns

### Draft Phase
Any agent creating or revising content:

```yaml
context_building:
  if round == 1:
    include:
      - shared_context (from seed)
      - requirements
      - constraints
  else:
    include:
      - shared_context (from seed)
      - previous_draft (round N-1)
      - feedback_received (round N-1)
      - cto_guidance (round N-1)

execution:
  constraint: sequential_only     # Memory-optimized sequential execution
  mode: sequential                # Always sequential
  timeout: 8 minutes
  
output:
  path: round${N}/${agent_name}.md
  format: markdown
```

### Feedback Phase
Any agent reviewing other agents' work:

```yaml
context_building:
  include:
    - all_current_drafts (round N)
    - rating_criteria
    - review_guidelines

execution:
  constraint: sequential_only     # Must be sequential (agents need to read each other's drafts)
  mode: sequential               # Overrides seed execution_mode
  timeout: 4 minutes
  
output:
  path: round${N}/${agent_name}_feedback.md
  format: structured_feedback
```

### Analysis Phase
Arbitrator analyzing convergence:

```yaml
context_building:
  include:
    - all_drafts (round N)
    - all_feedback (round N)
    - previous_analyses (rounds 1 to N-1)
    - convergence_criteria

execution:
  constraint: single_agent        # Only arbitrator agent runs
  agent: ${manifest.agents.arbitrator}
  timeout: 2 minutes
  
output:
  path: round${N}/cto_analysis.md
  decisions:
    - convergence_score
    - continue_or_stop
    - guidance_for_next
```

## Context Builder

```python
def build_context(session, phase, round_num):
    """
    Build context for any phase and round.
    Adapts automatically based on available data.
    """
    context = {
        'shared': session.seed.context,
        'round': round_num,
        'phase': phase.name
    }
    
    if phase.name == 'draft':
        if round_num > 1:
            # Add previous round data if it exists
            context['previous_draft'] = session.get_draft(round_num - 1)
            context['feedback'] = session.get_feedback(round_num - 1)
            context['guidance'] = session.get_analysis(round_num - 1)
    
    elif phase.name == 'feedback':
        # Add current round drafts for review
        context['review_targets'] = session.get_all_drafts(round_num)
        context['criteria'] = load_rating_criteria()
    
    elif phase.name == 'analysis':
        # Add all round data for convergence check
        context['current_round'] = session.get_round_data(round_num)
        context['history'] = session.get_all_rounds()
    
    return context
```

## User Checkpoint System

### Round Brief and Correction Request

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
```python
def handle_agent_failure(agent, phase, round_num):
    """
    Handle failures without breaking workflow.
    """
    if phase == 'draft':
        if round_num == 1:
            # Critical - retry once
            return retry_agent(agent, extended_timeout=True)
        else:
            # Use previous round draft
            return get_previous_draft(agent, round_num - 1)
    
    elif phase == 'feedback':
        # Non-critical - continue without
        return None
    
    elif phase == 'analysis':
        # Critical - must have analysis
        return force_basic_analysis(round_num)
```

## Directory Management

The workflow creates this structure dynamically:

```
.doh/committees/{feature}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ seed.md                  # Created by helper (unchanged)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ round1/                  # Created on first round
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ round2/                  # Created on second round
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ roundN/                  # Created as needed
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ final_analysis.md        # Created at end
```

No hardcoded round numbers - directories created as needed.

## Compatibility Notes

### Helper Scripts
No changes required to helper scripts. They continue to work with:
- `committee_create_seed()` - Creates seed.md
- `committee_read_seed()` - Reads seed.md
- `committee_create_final_prd()` - Creates PRD template

### Seed Format
Seed files only need to reference the new manifest:
```yaml
orchestration:
  type: prd-committee
  manifest: .claude/orchestration/prd-committee/manifest.md
```

### Agent Interface
Agents receive generic context and adapt based on what's present.
No agent-specific changes needed for N-round support.
