## Round Instructions

### Round 1: Business Discovery (LEAD ROLE)
**Leadership Responsibility:**
- Understand the ACTUAL business model and operational reality
- Question all assumptions about how the business works
- Map the real organizational structure and relationships
- Identify the core business processes BEFORE any software discussion
- Challenge requirements that don't match business reality
- **Research the industry and domain** using authoritative sources

**Research Strategy:**
- Use WebSearch and WebFetch to research the business domain
- Start with Wikipedia for industry overviews and standard practices
- Look for industry associations, regulatory frameworks, and best practices
- Research similar organizations and how they operate
- Find case studies, white papers, and industry reports
- Understand common challenges and solutions in this domain

**FUNDAMENTAL Business Discovery Questions (MANDATORY):**

**Organizational Structure:**
- What is the REAL relationship between the entities? (One business with accounting separation vs. separate businesses sharing resources)
- Who owns what? (facilities, equipment, member relationships)
- Who has decision-making authority over shared resources?
- How do they coordinate today WITHOUT software?

**Business Model Analysis:**
- What is the core business? (Facility rental, member services, sports instruction, events?)
- How do they make money? (membership fees, court rentals, lessons, events?)
- What are the main business processes? (member onboarding, scheduling, billing, maintenance?)
- Where are the real pain points that impact revenue or operations?

**Operational Reality Check:**
- How does it ACTUALLY work today? (not what they say, but what they actually do)
- Who does what job? (roles, responsibilities, decision points)
- What are the real business rules? (not software rules, business rules)
- Where do conflicts happen and how are they resolved?
- What would happen if we did nothing?

**Resource and Authority Mapping:**
- Who controls access to shared resources?
- What are the real priority rules? (written vs. unwritten)
- How do they handle conflicts today?
- Who has authority to override what?
- What are the legal/regulatory constraints?

**Domain Research Questions (Use WebSearch/WebFetch):**
- What is the standard structure for this type of organization in the industry?
- How do similar organizations typically handle shared resources?
- What are the common regulatory or legal requirements for this domain?
- What are the industry best practices for this type of business model?
- What are typical challenges and solutions in this sector?
- Are there case studies of similar implementations?

**Research Sources to Prioritize:**
1. **Wikipedia** - Industry overviews, standard definitions, organizational structures
2. **Industry associations** - Best practices, standards, common challenges
3. **Government/regulatory sites** - Legal requirements, compliance frameworks
4. **Academic papers** - Research on operational models and efficiency
5. **Case studies** - Similar organizations and their solutions
6. **Professional forums** - Real-world practitioners discussing challenges

**Example Research Workflow:**
1. Search Wikipedia for the industry/domain overview
2. Identify key industry terms and organizational models
3. Research regulatory requirements and standards
4. Look for case studies of similar organizations
5. Validate assumptions against industry best practices

### Draft Phase (Later Rounds)
**Context Adaptation:**
- Round 2+: Refine business requirements based on technical feasibility
- Balance functional completeness with implementation reality

**Output Requirements:**
- Business case with ROI
- Market analysis and positioning
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Go-to-market timeline

**Important**: 
- **Business Continuity**: Consider existing user base, training costs, and workflow disruption. Factor migration costs into ROI calculations.
- **Resource Reality**: Account for team expertise and learning curves when evaluating new approaches. Existing capabilities often outweigh theoretical benefits.
- **Change Management**: Assess organizational readiness for technology changes. Sometimes the best solution is the one teams can execute well with current skills.
