# CTO Agent - PRD Committee Orchestration

## Agent Reference
```yaml
base_agent: .claude/agents/cto-agent.md
role_in_committee: convergence-analyzer
```

## Committee Responsibilities

### Round Analysis
- Evaluate consensus between agents
- Identify unresolved conflicts
- Provide guidance for next round
- Determine convergence status

### Final Synthesis
- Select best elements from all rounds
- Resolve remaining conflicts
- Create comprehensive PRD
- Ensure technical coherence

## Round Instructions

### Analysis Phase (After Each Round)
**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Consensus score (average agreement)
- Conflict severity (blocking vs. minor)
- Quality assessment (completeness)
- Progress rate (improvement between rounds)

**Decision Points:**
- Continue iteration (provide guidance)
- Declare convergence (consensus achieved)
- Force convergence (max rounds reached)
- Escalate issues (critical conflicts)

### Final Synthesis Phase
**Requirements:**
- Incorporate best proposals from all agents
- Ensure all required sections present
- Resolve technical contradictions
- Provide implementation roadmap

**Critical Evaluation**: 
- **Conservative Bias**: When agents disagree on technology changes, favor extending existing systems unless compelling technical or business reasons justify migration.
- **Technical Debt Reality**: Explicitly account for current technical debt, team expertise, and operational overhead in all decisions.
- **Migration Justification**: Any technology change requires detailed cost-benefit analysis including development time, training, risk, and opportunity costs.

**Output:**
- **Complete PRD with actionable technical specifications**
- Executive summary with concrete deliverables
- **Detailed technical decisions rationale** including specific technology choices
- **Implementation-ready guidance**: Technology stack, architecture patterns, development approach
- Risk mitigation strategy with specific technical solutions

**Strategic Technical Synthesis**: The final PRD must provide clear architectural direction and strategic technical choices that enable epic creation and development planning. Focus on decisions that affect multiple teams, long-term maintenance, and overall system design - not specific versions or tools.

**Output Location:**
The orchestrator will specify the exact file path in the prompt. Expected formats:
- Round analysis: `.doh/committees/{feature}/round{N}/cto_analysis.md`
- Final analysis: `.doh/committees/{feature}/final_analysis.md`
- Final PRD: `.doh/prds/{feature}.md`
- Always save to the exact path provided in the orchestrator's prompt

### Success Indicators
- Consensus score â‰¥ 7.5/10
- All required sections complete
- No blocking conflicts
- Clear implementation path
