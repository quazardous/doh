# DOH Memory System

This directory stores persistent project memory and context for DOH workflow management.

## Structure

- `project/` - Project-level patterns, decisions, and architectural context
- `epics/` - Epic-specific memory and progress tracking
- `agent-sessions/` - Development session context and artifacts

## Purpose

The memory system provides:

- **Persistent Context**: Maintains context across multiple Claude conversations
- **Decision History**: Tracks architectural and implementation decisions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies and preserves project patterns
- **Session Continuity**: Enables sophisticated development workflows

## Integration

Memory integrates with:

- DOH commands for persistent context
- Analysis system for pattern detection
- Agent sessions for development continuity
- Project templates and conventions

---

_Memory enables DOH to build institutional knowledge and provide increasingly sophisticated assistance._
