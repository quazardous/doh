**Epic ID**: !0 **Status**: Active **GitHub Issue**: N/A **Created**: [AUTO_FILLED] **Updated**: [AUTO_FILLED]

---

## Description

Default epic for quick tasks that don't need dedicated epics yet. This epic serves as a catch-all for:

- Quick bug fixes and hotfixes
- Small feature improvements
- Maintenance tasks
- Exploratory work and spikes
- Tasks that don't yet justify their own epic

## Purpose

Epic #0 provides frictionless task creation via `/doh:quick` without the overhead of epic planning. When Epic #0
accumulates 6+ related tasks, the system will suggest graduating them to a dedicated epic.

## Tasks

_Tasks are added automatically via `/doh:quick` command_

## Graduation Criteria

When Epic #0 contains multiple related tasks (6+), consider creating a dedicated epic:

1. Identify related task patterns
2. Create focused epic via `/doh:epic`
3. Migrate related tasks to new epic
4. Update task references

## Notes

- This epic is permanent and cannot be deleted
- It serves as the entry point for all quick task creation
- Helps maintain project momentum without bureaucracy
- Automatic suggestions appear when graduation criteria are met

## System Notes

Epic #0 is managed automatically by the DOH system
