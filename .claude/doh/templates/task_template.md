## Version Tracking

### Three-Tier Version System

Tasks progress through version planning stages (only one field present at a time):

1. **Proposed Version**: Initial version suggestion at task creation
   - Set when task is first created
   - Indicates earliest possible version for consideration
   - Can be tentative or aspirational

2. **Target Version**: Mature planning commitment
   - Set when task is actively planned
   - Indicates intended delivery version
   - Subject to change based on priorities

3. **Version**: Frozen roadmap commitment
   - Set when version is locked in roadmap
   - Immutable once set (except for major replanning)
   - Can be set even if Status is "NOT PLANNED" for constraints

### Version Evolution Examples

```
New Task:         Proposed Version: 1.4.0
Planned Task:     Target Version: 1.4.0
Roadmap Lock:     Version: 1.4.0
Version Constraint: Version: 1.5.0 (must be in this version, Status: NOT PLANNED)
```
