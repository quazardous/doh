- **File Operations**: `list-files.sh`, `count-by-type.sh`, `recent-changes.sh`
- **Query Operations**: `epic-tasks.sh`, `status-summary.sh`, `dependency-graph.sh`

**Deliverable**: 
Prioritized roadmap for next wave of bash routine implementation with effort estimates, ROI calculations, and implementation patterns for consistent script development.

### T018 - Project Path Resolution Strategy âœ…

**Status**: COMPLETED (2025-08-27)  
**Priority**: High - Critical for cross-environment compatibility  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Target Version**: 1.4.0 âœ…  

Design and implement robust PROJECT_ROOT detection strategy that handles symlinks, encrypted filesystems, bind mounts, and preserves Claude Code working directory preference while ensuring bash script compatibility.

**Impact**: 
Current path resolution causes issues with symlinks, encrypted filesystems (.private), bind mounts, and different working directories. DOH scripts must work seamlessly whether launched from Claude Code directory or bash command line, with predictable behavior across all common filesystem scenarios.

**Tasks**: âœ… ALL COMPLETED
- [x] Analyze common filesystem scenarios (symlinks, .private encryption, bind mounts, NFS, WSL)
- [x] Define priority hierarchy: Claude CWD > explicit PROJECT_ROOT > .doh detection > fallback
- [x] Design path canonicalization strategy that preserves user's preferred working directory
- [x] Implement robust doh_find_project_root() with comprehensive fallback logic
- [x] Add path equivalency detection for common patterns (.private, symlinks, mounts)
- [x] Create configuration option for preferred project path (config.ini: project.preferred_path)
- [x] Create .doh/uuid file generation during /doh:init (uuidgen on-the-fly)
- [x] Implement project identity validation using .doh/uuid comparison
- [x] Implement discovered_paths cache system for known equivalent project paths  
- [x] Add auto-discovery mechanism that learns new path equivalents with UUID validation
- [x] Test across multiple filesystem scenarios (local, encrypted, network, containers)
- [x] Add debugging mode for path resolution troubleshooting (DOH_PATH_DEBUG=1)
- [x] Document path resolution behavior and troubleshooting guide
- [x] Update all existing bash scripts to use consistent path resolution

**Common Filesystem Scenarios to Handle**:
- **Symlinks**: `/home/user/dev/project` â†’ `/home/user/Private/dev/project`
- **Encrypted (.private)**: `/home/user/Private/` mounted from `/home/user/.private/`
- **Bind Mounts**: `/var/www/project` â†’ `/home/user/dev/project`
- **NFS/Network**: `/net/server/project` accessible from multiple paths
- **WSL**: Windows paths vs Linux paths, case sensitivity issues
- **Docker/Containers**: Volume mounts with different internal/external paths
- **Git Worktrees**: Multiple working directories for same repo

**Path Resolution Priority Strategy**:
1. **Claude Code Working Directory**: Preserve the directory where Claude Code was launched
2. **Explicit PROJECT_ROOT**: Honor environment variable if set by user
3. **Configuration Preference**: Use config.ini project.preferred_path if configured
4. **Automatic Detection**: Search upward for .doh directory with canonicalization
5. **Path Equivalency**: Check known equivalent paths (.private, common symlinks)
6. **Fallback Strategy**: Current directory with warning if no .doh found

**Advanced Features to Consider**:
- **Discovered Paths Cache**: Maintain `discovered_paths` registry of known equivalent paths
- **Path History**: Remember successful path resolutions in config with timestamps
- **Multiple Project Support**: Handle projects with multiple valid paths and aliases
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Windows, macOS, Linux path handling
- **Performance Optimization**: Cache path resolution results to avoid repeated filesystem queries
- **Validation**: Verify .doh directory integrity at resolved path

**Discovered Paths Implementation**:
```ini
[project]
canonical_path = /home/user/Private/dev/projects/myproject
preferred_path = /home/user/dev/projects/myproject
discovered_paths = /home/user/dev/projects/myproject,/home/user/Private/dev/projects/myproject
last_discovered = 2025-08-27T12:43:00Z
```

**Project Identity Validation**:
- Create `.doh/uuid` file during `/doh:init` with unique UUID (generated on-the-fly)
- Validate project identity by comparing UUIDs before adding to discovered_paths
- Prevents false positives between dev/prod/backup projects with same name

**Path Resolution with Discovery**:
1. Check `discovered_paths` cache for known equivalents
2. If cache miss, perform full detection and validate project UUID
3. Only add paths with matching `.doh/uuid` to discovered_paths
4. Validate cached paths periodically (24h) and prune invalid entries
5. Auto-discover new equivalent paths when same UUID found

**Deliverable**: âœ… COMPLETED
Robust path resolution system that works seamlessly across all common filesystem scenarios, preserves user's preferred working directory, and provides clear debugging when path issues occur.

### T023 - Prevent /init Auto-Trigger of /doh:init

**Status**: COMPLETED âœ… - 2025-08-27  
**Priority**: High - User experience improvement  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Target Version**: 1.4.0  

Ensure that `/init` command does not automatically trigger `/doh:init` without user consent.

**Solution Implemented**: 
Added mandatory confirmation prompt to `/doh:init` script. Now `/doh:init` always prompts users for confirmation before proceeding, making it cancellable even when auto-triggered by `/init`.

**Tasks**:
- [x] Review current `/init` command behavior and identify auto-trigger points
- [x] Add cancellable confirmation prompt to `doh-init.sh` script  
- [x] Add `--no-confirm` option for automated scenarios
- [x] Test that `/doh:init` can be cancelled when auto-triggered
- [x] Update documentation with confirmation-based solution

**Implementation Details**:
- Added `prompt_confirmation()` function that runs before any initialization
- Users can cancel with 'N' (default) or proceed with 'y'
- Added `--no-confirm` flag for scripts that need to skip confirmation
- Maintains backward compatibility while giving users control

**Deliverable**: âœ… COMPLETED
`/doh:init` now always prompts for user confirmation, making it safely cancellable even when auto-triggered by `/init`.

### TXXX - Title ðŸš©

**Status**: Not started / In progress / Ready to implement  
**Priority**: Critical / High / Medium / Low - Context explanation  
**Dependencies**: TXXX, TXXX or None  
**Target Version**: 1.3.0 / 1.4.0 / 2.0.0 (optional)  

Brief description in 1-2 sentences explaining what needs to be done and why.

**Impact**: 
Why this matters, who it affects, what happens if we don't do it.

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Concrete actionable task 1
- [ ] Concrete actionable task 2  
- [ ] Concrete actionable task 3

**Deliverable**: 
What will be produced when this TODO is completed.
```

### Rules

- Update **Next TODO ID** in header when adding new TODO
- Add to **Active TODOs** list with appropriate priority section  
- Keep descriptions concise and actionable
- Use GitHub-like format for clean diffs
- **Never move TODOs** when status changes (preserve diff history)
- Mark completed TODOs in CHANGELOG.md, not here
- Use Target Version for release planning (optional)

### Completion Workflow

When a TODO is completed:

1. **Update CHANGELOG.md**: Add entry with TODO reference and completion date
2. **Update VERSION.md**: If TODO affects version, update runtime/dev versions
3. **Remove from Active TODOs**: Remove completed TODO from priority sections
4. **Update dependencies**: Mark dependent TODOs as unblocked if applicable
5. **Archive TODO**: Move completed section to CHANGELOG, preserve TODO body for reference
