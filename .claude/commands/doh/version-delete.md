# /doh:version-delete

## Description
Remove a draft or planned version from the project. Released versions cannot be deleted to preserve project history.

## Usage
```
/doh:version-delete <version> [--force]
```

## Arguments
- `<version>`: The version number to delete (e.g., 2.0.0)
- `--force`: Skip confirmation prompt (optional)

## Implementation
The AI agent will:
1. Validate the version number format
2. Check if version file exists in `.doh/versions/{version}.md`
3. Parse version status from file
4. Prevent deletion if status is "released"
5. Check for dependencies:
   - Find PRDs/epics/tasks targeting this version
   - Warn if items depend on this version
6. Confirm deletion with user (unless --force)
7. Delete the version file
8. Update any referencing items to remove target_version

## Output Format
```
