# PRD Evolution Command

Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) using an advanced multi-agent committee workflow with user intervention points. This command leverages 4 specialized AI agents (DevOps Architect, Lead Developer, UX Designer, Product Owner) plus CTO arbitration to produce high-quality, consensus-driven PRDs through a structured collaborative process with mandatory user checkpoints after each round.

## Usage
```
/doh:prd-evo <natural language description>
```

## Examples
- `/doh:prd-evo gitlab support`
- `/doh:prd-evo add OAuth2 authentication to the API`
- `/doh:prd-evo version 2.0 database migration`
- `/doh:prd-evo user-notifications`

## Execution Mode
- **Sequential only**: Memory-optimized agent execution with context reduction

## Agents
- **Committee Orchestrator**: `.claude/agents/committee-orchestrator.md`
- **DevOps Architect**: `.claude/agents/devops-architect.md`
- **Lead Developer**: `.claude/agents/lead-developer.md`
- **UX Designer**: `.claude/agents/ux-designer.md`
- **Product Owner**: `.claude/agents/product-owner.md`

## Instructions

### 1. Parse Arguments and Execution Mode

From `$ARGUMENTS`, extract feature request and execution mode:

**Input Validation & Parsing:**
```bash
# Validate arguments exist
if [[ -z "$ARGUMENTS" ]] || [[ "$ARGUMENTS" =~ ^[[:space:]]*$ ]]; then
    echo "❌ Error: Feature request cannot be empty"
    echo "Usage: /doh:prd-evo <natural language description>"
    echo "Examples:"
    echo "  /doh:prd-evo gitlab support"  
    echo "  /doh:prd-evo user authentication system"
    exit 1
fi

# No flags supported - sequential only
if [[ "$ARGUMENTS" =~ -- ]]; then
    echo "❌ Error: Flags not supported"
    echo "Usage: /doh:prd-evo <description>"
    exit 1
fi

# Sequential execution only
EXECUTION_MODE="sequential"
FEATURE_REQUEST="$ARGUMENTS"

# Clean up feature request
FEATURE_REQUEST=$(echo "$FEATURE_REQUEST" | sed 's/^[[:space:]]*//;s/[[:space:]]*$//')
```

### 2. Initial Context Gathering

From cleaned `$FEATURE_REQUEST`, gather project context:

**Pre-flight Checks (Critical):**
```bash
# Validate DOH project is initialized
if [[ ! -d ".doh" ]]; then
    echo "❌ Error: Not a DOH project (missing .doh directory)"
    echo "Initialize with: /doh:init"
    exit 1
fi

# Check committee infrastructure exists
if [[ ! -f ".claude/agents/committee-orchestrator.md" ]]; then
    echo "❌ Error: Committee infrastructure missing"
    echo "Required file: .claude/agents/committee-orchestrator.md"
    exit 1
fi

# Check version system exists  
CURRENT_VERSION=$(cat VERSION 2>/dev/null || echo "0.1.0")
if [[ ! -f "VERSION" ]]; then
    echo "⚠️ Warning: VERSION file missing, using default: 0.1.0"
fi
```

**Context Gathering (Silently check):**
1. Read VERSION file or use default
2. Check `.doh/versions/` for planned versions and roadmap  
3. List `.doh/prds/` to see existing PRDs
4. Check `.doh/epics/` for related work in progress
5. Validate committee seed template exists

**Note**: Seed file check will happen after feature concept clarification creates the feature name/slug.

### 3. Initial Feature Concept Clarification (MANDATORY)

**GOAL: Create feature name/slug from concept understanding**

Focus on core concept understanding to generate meaningful feature name before detailed discovery:

```
🏛️ Committee PRD Creation for: "$FEATURE_REQUEST"
=============================================

Before diving deep with our 4-agent committee, let me understand the main feature concept:

**Core Concept Questions:**
1. **What is the main thing this feature does?**
   - In one sentence, what would users say this feature is for?
   - What's the primary action or capability it provides?

2. **Who is this primarily for?**
   - What type of users would use this most?
   - Are they internal users, external customers, or administrators?

3. **How does this fit into the bigger picture?**
   - Is this a completely new feature area or enhancing something existing?
   - Does this replace something, add to something, or create something new?

4. **What's the rough scope?**
   - Is this more like: a new page/screen, a workflow improvement, system integration, or major platform addition?

This helps me propose a focused feature name and scope before our committee session.
(The committee will then dive deep into requirements, technical feasibility, and implementation details)
```

### 4. Synthesize Initial Feature Understanding

Based on concept clarification, create initial understanding:

**Determine Preliminary Feature Concept:**
- Focus on the **core value proposition** and **main user benefit**
- Don't commit to technical implementation yet
- Capture the **"what"** before the **"how"**
- Examples:
  - "member management system" → Organization member management platform concept
  - "gitlab support" → Development workflow integration concept  
  - "user notifications" → Communication system concept

**Generate Feature Name/Slug:**
Based on user answers, create kebab-case feature name:
```bash
# Algorithm for feature name generation:
# 1. Extract key nouns from main capability (user answers to question 1)
# 2. Add context from primary users (question 2) if relevant
# 3. Include scope indication (question 4) if it clarifies purpose
# 4. Convert to kebab-case, validate uniqueness

# Examples:
# "Organization member management" → "member-management-system"  
# "GitLab integration for deployments" → "gitlab-deployment-integration"
# "User notification system" → "user-notification-system"
# "OAuth2 authentication for API" → "oauth2-api-authentication"
```

**Feature Name Rules:**
- Must start with letter, contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens
- Should be 2-4 words that capture the essence
- Must be unique (not exist in .doh/prds/)
- Should be self-documenting (readable without context)
- Avoid generic words like "feature", "improvement", "enhancement"

**Present Initial Understanding:**
```
🎯 Feature Concept Summary
==========================

Based on your input, I understand this as:

**Core Feature:** ${MAIN_CAPABILITY_DESCRIPTION}
**Primary Users:** ${USER_TYPE_IDENTIFIED}  
**Scope Category:** ${SCOPE_CLASSIFICATION}
**Integration Level:** ${NEW_VS_ENHANCEMENT}

**Preliminary Feature Focus Areas:**
${BULLET_LIST_OF_MAIN_AREAS}

Does this capture the main idea correctly?
1. ✅ Yes, let's proceed to detailed discovery
2. 🔄 Let me clarify the concept
3. ✏️ Adjust the focus/scope
```

### 5. Industry Research Phase (WebSearch)

**After concept confirmation, conduct industry research to inform committee:**

```
🔍 Industry Research for Committee Context
========================================

Before our expert committee analyzes your feature, let me gather industry context that will inform their analysis.

This research will be provided to the committee agents to enhance their domain expertise.
```

**Step 1: Business Domain Identification**

Based on the feature concept and user responses, identify the specific business domain/industry:

**Domain Identification Process:**
```
🏢 Business Domain Analysis
==========================

Analyzing feature request: "$FEATURE_REQUEST"

Based on your feature description, I need to understand the business domain to conduct relevant industry research.

What type of business/organization is this for?

Examples by domain:
• Sports/Recreation: clubs, gyms, sports leagues, fitness centers
• Healthcare: hospitals, clinics, medical practices, pharmacies  
• Education: schools, universities, training centers, e-learning
• Retail/E-commerce: stores, online shops, marketplaces, suppliers
• Financial Services: banks, insurance, accounting, fintech
• Manufacturing: factories, warehouses, supply chain, logistics
• Professional Services: consultancy, legal, real estate, agencies
• Government/Public: municipalities, agencies, non-profits
• Technology: SaaS, software companies, IT services, startups

Which category best describes your business?
```

**Interactive Domain Selection:**
```bash
# Present domain options based on feature analysis
echo "🏢 Business Domain Identification"
echo "Feature: $FEATURE_REQUEST"
echo ""
echo "Select the primary business domain:"
echo "1. Sports/Recreation Management"
echo "2. Healthcare/Medical Services"  
echo "3. Education/Training"
echo "4. Retail/E-commerce"
echo "5. Financial Services"
echo "6. Manufacturing/Logistics"
echo "7. Professional Services"
echo "8. Government/Public Sector"
echo "9. Technology/Software"
echo "10. Other (specify)"
echo ""
read -p "Domain selection (1-10): " domain_choice

case $domain_choice in
    1) PRIMARY_DOMAIN="Sports/Recreation Management" ;;
    2) PRIMARY_DOMAIN="Healthcare/Medical Services" ;;
    3) PRIMARY_DOMAIN="Education/Training" ;;
    4) PRIMARY_DOMAIN="Retail/E-commerce" ;;
    5) PRIMARY_DOMAIN="Financial Services" ;;
    6) PRIMARY_DOMAIN="Manufacturing/Logistics" ;;
    7) PRIMARY_DOMAIN="Professional Services" ;;
    8) PRIMARY_DOMAIN="Government/Public Sector" ;;
    9) PRIMARY_DOMAIN="Technology/Software" ;;
    10) 
        read -p "Specify your business domain: " PRIMARY_DOMAIN
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Invalid selection. Using 'General Business'"
        PRIMARY_DOMAIN="General Business"
        ;;
esac

# Get sub-domain specifics
echo ""
read -p "More specific area within $PRIMARY_DOMAIN: " SUB_DOMAIN
SUB_DOMAIN=${SUB_DOMAIN:-$PRIMARY_DOMAIN}

# Set industry context for research
INDUSTRY_CONTEXT="$PRIMARY_DOMAIN"
BUSINESS_DOMAIN="$PRIMARY_DOMAIN/$SUB_DOMAIN"
FEATURE_TYPE=$(echo "$FEATURE_REQUEST" | grep -oE "(system|platform|tool|integration|management|service)" | head -1)
FEATURE_TYPE=${FEATURE_TYPE:-"solution"}

echo ""
echo "✅ Domain identified: $BUSINESS_DOMAIN"
echo "   Research context: $INDUSTRY_CONTEXT"
echo "   Feature type: $FEATURE_TYPE"
```

**Present Domain Identification:**
```
🏢 Business Domain Identified
============================

Based on your feature concept, I've identified the business domain as:
**Primary Domain:** ${PRIMARY_DOMAIN}
**Sub-Domain:** ${SUB_DOMAIN}
**Industry Context:** ${INDUSTRY_CONTEXT}

This will guide our industry research to find relevant standards, regulations, and best practices.

Is this domain identification correct?
1. ✅ Yes, proceed with research
2. 🔄 Let me clarify the business domain
3. ✏️ Adjust the domain focus
```

**Step 2: Client Business Understanding Research (executed by prd-evo command):**

Focus: Le comité connaît le software, pas le métier du client.

```bash
echo "🔍 Researching client business domain to educate committee..."

# 1. What does this business actually DO day-to-day?
echo "  → Understanding daily operations..."
DAILY_OPERATIONS=$(WebSearch "${PRIMARY_DOMAIN} daily operations typical day workflow" 2>/dev/null || echo "Operations research unavailable")

# 2. Who are the key people and what are their roles?
echo "  → Identifying key stakeholders..."
KEY_STAKEHOLDERS=$(WebSearch "${SUB_DOMAIN} key roles responsibilities who does what" 2>/dev/null || echo "Stakeholder research unavailable")

# 3. How does this business actually make money?
echo "  → Understanding business model..."
BUSINESS_MODEL=$(WebSearch "${PRIMARY_DOMAIN} business model revenue how they make money" 2>/dev/null || echo "Business model research unavailable")

# 4. What are the main pain points in this industry?
echo "  → Identifying common challenges..."
BUSINESS_CHALLENGES=$(WebSearch "${SUB_DOMAIN} common problems challenges pain points" 2>/dev/null || echo "Challenges research unavailable")

# 5. What does success look like in this business?
echo "  → Understanding success metrics..."
SUCCESS_METRICS=$(WebSearch "${PRIMARY_DOMAIN} success metrics KPIs what good looks like" 2>/dev/null || echo "Success metrics research unavailable")

echo "✅ Business understanding research complete"
```

**Research Context Capture:**
```
✅ Client Business Understanding Research Complete
================================================

**Business Domain:** ${PRIMARY_DOMAIN} / ${SUB_DOMAIN}

**📋 What the Committee Now Understands About Client's Business:**

**Daily Operations:**
${DAILY_OPERATIONS}

**Key People & Roles:**
${KEY_STAKEHOLDERS}

**Business Model (How They Make Money):**
${BUSINESS_MODEL}

**Common Challenges in This Business:**
${BUSINESS_CHALLENGES}

**Success Metrics & Goals:**
${SUCCESS_METRICS}

**Context for Committee:**
This business understanding will be provided to the software committee so they can:
- Design solutions that fit the client's actual day-to-day operations
- Understand who will use the software and how
- Identify the real business value and ROI opportunities
- Anticipate operational challenges specific to this business type
- Create software that makes sense in the client's world, not just technically
```

### 6. Check for Existing Seed and PRD Files

**After feature name is determined, check if work already exists:**

**Feature Name Validation (Critical):**
```bash
# Validate feature name format
if [[ ! "$FEATURE_NAME" =~ ^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]$ ]] || [[ "$FEATURE_NAME" =~ -- ]]; then
    echo "❌ Error: Invalid feature name '${FEATURE_NAME}'"
    echo "Rules: Must start with letter, contain only lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens"
    echo "       Cannot have consecutive hyphens, must end with letter/number"
    echo "Examples: 'user-auth', 'gitlab-integration', 'member-management'"
    exit 1
fi

# Validate feature name length
if [[ ${#FEATURE_NAME} -lt 3 ]] || [[ ${#FEATURE_NAME} -gt 50 ]]; then
    echo "❌ Error: Feature name '${FEATURE_NAME}' must be 3-50 characters"
    exit 1
fi
```

**Critical Check - PRD exists = ABORT:**
```bash
# First check if PRD already exists (abort if true)
if [ -f ".doh/prds/${FEATURE_NAME}.md" ]; then
    echo "⚠️ PRD '${FEATURE_NAME}' already exists!"
    echo "   File: .doh/prds/${FEATURE_NAME}.md"
    echo ""
    echo "Options:"
    echo "1. ✏️ Edit existing PRD: /doh:prd-edit ${FEATURE_NAME}"
    echo "2. 🔄 Choose a different feature name"
    echo "3. ❌ Cancel PRD creation"
    exit 1
fi
```

**If PRD exists, present options and ABORT committee creation:**
```
⚠️ PRD Already Exists: ${FEATURE_NAME}
====================================

A PRD already exists for this feature at: .doh/prds/${FEATURE_NAME}.md

Committee PRD creation cannot proceed. Choose an option:
1. ✏️ Edit existing PRD: /doh:prd-edit ${FEATURE_NAME}
2. 🔄 Use a different feature name and restart
3. 👁️ View existing PRD content first
4. ❌ Cancel

Committee evolution is for NEW PRDs only.
```

**Secondary Check - Seed file exists (if PRD doesn't exist):**
```bash
# Only if PRD doesn't exist, check for seed file
./.claude/scripts/doh/helper.sh committee seed_exists "${FEATURE_NAME}"
```

**If seed file exists (but no PRD):**
```
📋 Found existing context for: ${FEATURE_NAME}
=====================================

A seed file exists from a previous discovery session, but no PRD was created yet.

Options:
1. ✅ Use existing context and proceed to committee
2. 🔄 Review and update the existing context
3. 🗑️ Start fresh (delete existing seed)
4. 👁️ View existing seed content
```

**Handle existing seed:**
- **Use existing**: Skip to Committee Session Execution, read seed file directly
- **Review/update**: Display seed content, allow modifications through discovery questions
- **Start fresh**: Delete seed, continue with normal discovery flow
- **View content**: Show seed, then ask for choice again

### 7. Comprehensive Discovery Phase (After Concept Confirmation)

**Act as Project Management Consultant - Audience-Aware Discovery:**

```
🏛️ Great! Now for detailed discovery with our committee approach.

As your Project Management Consultant, I'll tailor our discovery session to your expertise level.
The Committee Evolution process uses 4 specialized agents as expert consultants.

**First, help me understand your background:**
What's your role/expertise? (e.g., Lead Developer, Product Manager, Sales, CEO, Designer, etc.)

This helps me ask the right questions and leverage your knowledge effectively.
```

**IMPORTANT - Context Capture Rules:**
- **Team Constraints**: Never let temporary resources (interns, junior developers) drive technical architecture decisions
- **Default Assumption**: Committee analyzes for experienced development team unless explicitly specified otherwise
- **Resource Mentions**: If client mentions limited resources, capture as "some [technology] knowledge available" not as primary constraint
- **Quality First**: Technical choices should prioritize scalability, maintainability, and best practices
- **Accommodation**: Resource limitations can be accommodated through training, documentation, or phased implementation

**Based on user's role, adapt the discovery questions:**

### For Technical Roles (Lead Dev, DevOps, Architect, etc.):
```
**Technical & Functional Discovery:**

🎯 **Business Context:**
   - What specific problem does "$FEATURE_REQUEST" solve?
   - What's the user impact and business value?

🔧 **Technical Deep Dive:**
   - Any architectural constraints or preferences?
   - Performance/scalability requirements you foresee?
   - Integration challenges with current stack?
   - Security/compliance considerations?
   - Technical debt or refactoring opportunities?
   - Database schema or API changes needed?
   - Testing strategy concerns?

🚀 **Implementation Context:**
   - Timeline constraints or delivery pressures?
   - Resource availability (team, budget)?
   - Dependencies on other systems/teams?
```

### For Business Roles (Product Manager, CEO, etc.):
```
**Business & Functional Discovery:**

🎯 **Business Context:**
   - What specific problem does "$FEATURE_REQUEST" solve for users?
   - Who are the main users affected by this issue?
   - What happens if we don't build this feature?
   - What does success look like from a user perspective?

💼 **Strategic Context:**
   - How does this align with business objectives?
   - What's the expected ROI or business impact?
   - Any competitive pressures or market drivers?
   - User research or data supporting this need?

📋 **Functional Requirements:**
   - What key functionality would make users happy?
   - Any critical requirements or deal-breakers?
   - Integration with existing workflows?
   - Compliance or regulatory considerations?
```

### For Non-Technical Roles (Sales, Marketing, etc.):
```
**Functional Discovery:**

🎯 **User Problem:**
   - What specific problem does "$FEATURE_REQUEST" solve for users?
   - Who benefits and how do they currently handle this?
   - What would successful implementation look like to users?

💡 **Functional Vision:**
   - What key functionality is essential?
   - How should users interact with this feature?
   - Any examples from competitors or other tools?
   - What would make this feature a "must-have"?

📈 **Business Impact:**
   - How does this help achieve business goals?
   - What's the urgency or priority level?
   - Any constraints you're aware of (budget, timeline, etc.)?
```

**What I'll Auto-Discover Based on Your Technical Level:**
✅ Technology stack and architecture (from your codebase)
✅ Current version and roadmap alignment (from .doh files)  
✅ Technical constraints and debt (through code analysis)
✅ Integration points and dependencies (from project structure)
✅ Security and infrastructure concerns (expert analysis)
✅ Design patterns and UX consistency (existing system review)

**Committee Consultant Expertise:**
• 🏗️ DevOps Architect → Infrastructure, security, scalability analysis
• 💻 Lead Developer → Technical feasibility, architecture decisions  
• 🎨 UX Designer → User experience flow, accessibility review
• 💼 Product Owner → Business case refinement, market positioning

I'll match my questions to your expertise level and let the expert committee handle the gaps.

### 8. Intelligent Parameter Synthesis

After gathering detailed context, synthesize the information into concrete parameters:

**Determine Feature Name:**
- **MUST capture the main idea/purpose** (not just literal conversion)
- Convert to meaningful kebab-case that conveys intent
- Examples of good naming:
  - "gitlab support" → `gitlab-integration` (not just "gitlab-support")
  - "fix login bugs" → `auth-stability` (captures the goal)
  - "make it faster" → `performance-optimization` (descriptive of purpose)
  - "add users page" → `user-management` (broader feature context)
- Ensure it's unique and check against existing PRDs
- Should be self-documenting (someone should understand the feature from the name)

**Craft Description:**
- Concise summary (max 100 chars) that expands on the name
- Captures the business value and outcome
- Complements the feature name with additional context

**Determine Version Alignment:**
- **DELEGATE to version system**: Let `/doh:version` handle version analysis and assignment
- Based on discovery answers, the version system will:
  - Analyze feature scope and impact (patch/minor/major)
  - Check existing versions for suitable placement
  - Create new version if needed
  - Update existing version if appropriate
- **Do not manually analyze version impact** - let the version command handle this expertise

**Version Delegation Process:**
```bash
# This will be handled automatically during validation if needed
# /doh:version will determine:
# - Whether feature fits in existing planned versions
# - If new version is needed based on scope
# - Appropriate version number based on impact analysis
```

### 9. Present Comprehensive Understanding (MANDATORY)

**Show full context before starting committee session:**

```
🏛️ Committee PRD Planning Summary for "$FEATURE_REQUEST"
========================================================

**Understanding of the Feature:**
${SUMMARIZE_PROBLEM_AND_SOLUTION}

**Proposed PRD Parameters:**
   Feature name: ${FEATURE_NAME}
   Description: ${DESCRIPTION}
   Target version: ${TARGET_VERSION} (to be validated/assigned by version system)

**Committee Configuration:**
   - Execution mode: Sequential (memory optimized)
   - User checkpoints: Enabled (mandatory confirmation after each round)
   - Complexity: ${HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW}
   - User impact: ${DESCRIPTION}
   - Breaking changes: ${YES/NO}
   - Dependencies: ${LIST_OR_NONE}
   - Estimated duration: ~15-20 minutes (including user interactions)

**Agent Focus Areas:**
   - 🏗️ DevOps: Infrastructure, security, scalability concerns
   - 💻 Lead Dev: Technical architecture, implementation feasibility
   - 🎨 UX: User experience, accessibility, design consistency
   - 💼 PO: Business requirements, market fit, success metrics

**Roadmap Alignment:**
   - Current version: ${CURRENT_VERSION}
   - Fits in version: ${TARGET_VERSION}
   - Related PRDs: ${LIST_OR_NONE}
   - Related epics: ${LIST_OR_NONE}

**Key Requirements Identified:**
   ${BULLET_LIST_OF_KEY_REQUIREMENTS}

Is this understanding correct? Should I proceed with committee session?
1. ✅ Yes, start committee PRD creation
2. 📝 Let me provide more context
3. ✏️ Adjust the parameters
4. 📋 Create a new version first
```

### 10. Handle User Response

Based on user choice:

**Option 1 (Proceed with Committee):**
- Continue to validation and committee session

**Option 2 (More context):**
- Ask specific follow-up questions
- Refine understanding
- Present updated summary

**Option 3 (Adjust):**
```
Which parameters need adjustment?
- Feature name (current: ${FEATURE_NAME})
- Description (current: ${DESCRIPTION})  
- Target version (current: ${TARGET_VERSION})
- Other aspects of scope/requirements

Please provide the corrections.
```

**Option 4 (New version):**
- **DELEGATE to version command**: Execute `/doh:version-new for ${FEATURE_NAME} - ${DESCRIPTION}`
- **Let version-new handle:** Version number inference, discovery, and creation
- After version creation completes, return to PRD creation with the created version
- DO NOT manually create version files or specify version numbers

### 11. Pre-Committee Validation

**After confirmation, validate gate check requirements:**

1. **PM Consultant Gate Check (Client-Friendly Approach):**
   Minimize requirements while maximizing auto-discovery:
   ```bash
   # Validate or generate feature name
   if [[ -z "${FEATURE_NAME}" ]] || ! echo "${FEATURE_NAME}" | grep -qE '^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]$'; then
       # Try to generate from description if needed
       FEATURE_NAME=$(echo "${DESCRIPTION}" | sed 's/[^a-z0-9]/-/g' | sed 's/--*/-/g' | sed 's/^-\|-$//g')
   fi
   
   # Auto-discover technical context (PM consultant does the heavy lifting)
   CURRENT_STACK=$(discover_tech_stack_from_project_files)  # Smart discovery from package.json, etc.
   CURRENT_VERSION=$(cat VERSION 2>/dev/null || git describe --tags 2>/dev/null || echo "0.1.0")
   TECHNICAL_CONTEXT=$(analyze_existing_architecture)  # Analyzes .doh, README, codebase
   TARGET_VERSION=${TARGET_VERSION:-$(increment_version "$CURRENT_VERSION" "minor")}
   EXECUTION_MODE=${EXECUTION_MODE:-"sequential"}
   
   # Only require basic business direction (understanding client limitations)
   [ -n "${DESCRIPTION}" ] && ([ -n "${PROBLEM_SUMMARY}" ] || can_infer_business_context_from_description)
   ```
   
   **Client-friendly messaging when business direction is insufficient:**
   ```
   💼 PM Consultant Check: Quick Business Context Needed
   ====================================================
   
   I can handle all the technical discovery from your project, but need minimal business context:
   
   Missing:
   ❓ What user problem does this solve?
   ❓ What would successful implementation look like?
   
   ✅ I'll auto-discover: tech stack, architecture, constraints, dependencies, versions
   ✅ Committee will refine: detailed requirements, technical solutions, implementation plan
   
   Just help me understand the "why" - I'll figure out the "how."
   ```
   
   **Auto-discovery successful (emphasize value delivered):**
   ```
   ✅ PM Consultant Ready - Full Project Analysis Complete
   =====================================================
   
   Auto-discovered technical context:
   • Current stack: ${DISCOVERED_STACK}
   • Version roadmap: ${CURRENT_VERSION} → ${TARGET_VERSION}
   • Architecture patterns: ${DISCOVERED_ARCHITECTURE}
   • Existing constraints: ${DISCOVERED_CONSTRAINTS}
   
   Committee consultants will now provide:
   • Cross-functional technical analysis
   • Implementation feasibility assessment  
   • User experience optimization
   • Business requirements refinement
   
   You've provided the business direction - we'll handle the technical complexity.
   ```

2. **Check PRD doesn't exist:**
   ```bash
   [ -f ".doh/prds/${FEATURE_NAME}.md" ]
   ```
   If exists: "⚠️ PRD '${FEATURE_NAME}' already exists. Options:
   - Edit existing: /doh:prd-edit ${FEATURE_NAME}
   - Use different name
   - Overwrite (loses content)"

3. **Verify target version exists (if specified):**
   ```bash
   [ -f ".doh/versions/${TARGET_VERSION}.md" ]
   ```
   If not: 
   ```
   Version ${TARGET_VERSION} doesn't exist yet.
   
   Should I create it for you?
   1. ✅ Yes, create version ${TARGET_VERSION}
   2. 🔄 Choose a different version
   3. ❌ Cancel PRD creation
   ```
   
   If user agrees, **DELEGATE**: `/doh:version-new for ${FEATURE_NAME} - ${DESCRIPTION}`

### 12. Committee Session Execution

**After user confirmation, create seed file and launch committee:**

#### 12a. Create Seed File with Initial Context

**First, save the gathered context to a seed file:**

```bash
# Create seed directory structure
doh_dir=$(doh_project_dir) || return 1
seed_dir="$doh_dir/committees/${FEATURE_NAME}"
seed_file="$seed_dir/seed.md"

mkdir -p "$seed_dir" || {
    echo "❌ Failed to create committee directory: $seed_dir" >&2
    return 1
}

echo "📝 Creating seed file from template..."

# Process template directly
template_file=".claude/orchestration/prd-committee/templates/seed.md"
if [[ ! -f "$template_file" ]]; then
    echo "❌ Error: Template not found: $template_file" >&2
    return 1
fi

# Generate seed file with discovered and provided context - SAFE substitution
# Use temporary file approach to handle special characters safely
temp_file=$(mktemp) || {
    echo "❌ Failed to create temporary file" >&2
    return 1
}

# Copy template and substitute variables safely
cp "$template_file" "$temp_file" || {
    echo "❌ Failed to copy template file" >&2
    rm -f "$temp_file"
    return 1
}

# Use printf to safely escape special characters in variables
printf -v ESCAPED_FEATURE_NAME '%q' "${FEATURE_NAME}"
printf -v ESCAPED_DESCRIPTION '%q' "${DESCRIPTION:-}"
printf -v ESCAPED_TARGET_VERSION '%q' "${TARGET_VERSION:-}" 
printf -v ESCAPED_EXECUTION_MODE '%q' "${EXECUTION_MODE}"
printf -v ESCAPED_TIMESTAMP '%q' "$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")"

# Perform safe substitutions using perl instead of sed for better special char handling
perl -pi -e "
    s/\{\{FEATURE_NAME\}\}/${FEATURE_NAME}/g;

#### 12b. Launch Committee Session

```
🏛️ Starting Committee PRD Session...
=====================================

Feature: ${FEATURE_NAME}
Description: ${DESCRIPTION}
Target Version: ${TARGET_VERSION}

✅ Context saved to seed file
Launching committee orchestrator...
```

**Use Task tool to launch committee-orchestrator agent:**

The committee-orchestrator agent will:
1. Read seed file directly: .doh/committees/${FEATURE_NAME}/seed.md
2. Session structure will be initialized automatically by seed_create
3. Execute Round 1: Use Task tool to launch 4 sequential agents (devops-architect, lead-developer, ux-designer, product-owner)
4. **USER CHECKPOINT**: Present round 1 brief and ask for corrections/guidance
5. Use committee.sh functions to collect ratings and manage feedback
6. Execute Round 2: Use Task tool again for agent revisions based on user feedback and agent reviews
7. **USER CHECKPOINT**: Present round 2 brief and ask for corrections/guidance  
8. Continue rounds as needed (max 3) with user checkpoints after each
9. Perform convergence analysis and create final PRD
10. Use ./.claude/scripts/doh/helper.sh to save final PRD to .doh/prds/${FEATURE_NAME}.md

**Task invocation with error handling:**
```
subagent_type: committee-orchestrator
prompt: Execute complete committee PRD workflow for "${FEATURE_NAME}" using Project Management Consultant approach.

The seed file has been created at .doh/committees/${FEATURE_NAME}/seed.md with discovered and provided context.
Read the seed file directly at .doh/committees/${FEATURE_NAME}/seed.md for the full context.

**PROJECT MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT MODE:**
The committee acts as consultants who can discover context during analysis:
- Auto-discovered technical context is available in seed (current_stack, technical_context)
- Some fields marked "Committee to [action]" should be developed by agents during draft phase
- Agents should analyze existing project to discover technical debt, constraints, dependencies
- Business context should be refined through cross-functional analysis

**EXECUTION MODE: Sequential with User Checkpoints**
- Launch agents one by one with memory optimization and context reduction
- Present brief summary after each round
- Wait for mandatory user confirmation/corrections before continuing
- Apply user interventions (CTO decisions, client requirements, general corrections) to influence next round

**DISCOVERY EMPHASIS:**
- DevOps: Analyze existing infrastructure, discover deployment patterns and security context
- Lead Developer: Examine current codebase for technical debt, architecture patterns, integration points  
- UX Designer: Evaluate existing design systems, user flows, accessibility considerations
- Product Owner: Refine business requirements, develop success criteria, assess market positioning

**USER INTERVENTION APPROACH:**
- Express yourself naturally in any language
- AI automatically detects if you're speaking as CTO, client, or general stakeholder
- Technical feedback → Overrides agent technical decisions
- Business feedback → Updates requirements and priorities
- General feedback → Provides guidance and corrections
- Empty input → Continue with current direction

*AI-powered intent recognition, responds in user's language*

**ERROR HANDLING:**
If committee session fails:
1. Save session state to .doh/committees/${FEATURE_NAME}/session_failed.md
2. Provide recovery options to user
3. Offer manual PRD creation as fallback

Use existing DOH committee infrastructure:
- helper.sh committee commands for session management and seed access
- committee.sh library for workflow coordination  
- Task tool for agent coordination (devops-architect, lead-developer, ux-designer, product-owner)
- Save final PRD in standard DOH format to .doh/prds/${FEATURE_NAME}.md

IMPORTANT: Respect the execution mode specified in the seed file frontmatter.
```

**Handle committee orchestrator failure:**
```bash
# Check if Task tool execution succeeded
if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
    echo "❌ Committee session failed"
    echo ""
    echo "Recovery options:"
    echo "1. 🔄 Retry committee session"
    echo "2. 📝 Create manual PRD: /doh:prd-new ${FEATURE_NAME} \"${DESCRIPTION}\""
    echo "3. 👁️ View session logs: .doh/committees/${FEATURE_NAME}/"
    echo "4. 🧹 Clean up and start fresh"
    echo ""
    echo "Committee session details saved for debugging."
    exit 1
fi
```

### 13. Post-Committee Processing

After committee session completes, validate and enhance results:

**Check committee output:**
```bash
# Verify committee session completed
[ -d "committees/${FEATURE_NAME}" ]
[ -f ".doh/prds/${FEATURE_NAME}.md" ]
```

**Present results:**
```
✅ Committee PRD Session Complete
=================================

**Created:** .doh/prds/${FEATURE_NAME}.md
**Session Details:** committees/${FEATURE_NAME}/
**Duration:** ${ACTUAL_DURATION} minutes
**Agents Participated:** 4 specialized agents + CTO arbitration

**Committee Insights:**
• 🏗️ DevOps concerns: ${DEVOPS_KEY_POINTS}
• 💻 Lead Dev insights: ${LEADDEV_KEY_POINTS}  
• 🎨 UX considerations: ${UX_KEY_POINTS}
• 💼 PO requirements: ${PO_KEY_POINTS}

**Consensus Level:** ${CONVERGENCE_SCORE}

The PRD incorporates multi-perspective analysis and cross-functional alignment.
```

### 14. Final Summary

```
✅ Committee PRD Creation Complete
=================================

**Created:** .doh/prds/${FEATURE_NAME}.md
**Description:** ${DESCRIPTION}
**Target Version:** ${TARGET_VERSION}
**Committee Session:** committees/${FEATURE_NAME}/

**Multi-Agent Analysis Captured:**
${BULLET_LIST_OF_COMMITTEE_INSIGHTS}

**Cross-Functional Alignment:**
• Technical feasibility validated by Lead Developer
• Security/infrastructure concerns addressed by DevOps
• User experience optimized by UX Designer  
• Business requirements refined by Product Owner

**Next Steps:**
• Review committee minutes: committees/${FEATURE_NAME}/session.md
• Edit if needed: /doh:prd-edit ${FEATURE_NAME}
• Create epic: /doh:prd-parse ${FEATURE_NAME}
• View all PRDs: ./.claude/scripts/doh/helper.sh prd list
• Check version plan: /doh:version-show ${TARGET_VERSION}
```

## Important Rules

1. **UNDERSTAND FIRST** - Never start committee without comprehensive context
2. **ROADMAP AWARENESS** - Always check versions and existing work  
3. **USER CONFIRMATION** - Explicit approval required before committee session
4. **COMMITTEE ORCHESTRATOR** - Always use `.claude/agents/committee-orchestrator.md` for session management
5. **CONTEXT PRESERVATION** - Pass complete discovery context to committee
6. **EXACT PARAMETERS** - Maintain same parameter standards as /doh:prd-new
7. **VALIDATE EVERYTHING** - Check names, versions, duplicates before committee
8. **VERSION DELEGATION** - NEVER manually create version files; always use `/doh:version-new`

## Error Handling

- If committee session fails, offer fallback to solo mode
- Present committee session minutes for debugging
- Enable session recovery for interrupted committees  
- Suggest `./.claude/scripts/doh/helper.sh committee help` for committee issues
- If version doesn't exist, **DELEGATE to /doh:version** 
- If PRD exists, never overwrite without explicit confirmation

## Committee vs Solo Mode

**Use Committee Mode When:**
- Complex cross-functional features
- Security-sensitive implementations
- User-facing functionality changes
- Multi-system integrations
- Unclear technical requirements

**Consider Solo Mode For:**
- Simple bug fixes or minor improvements
- Well-defined technical tasks
- Urgent timeline requirements
- Prototype or experimental work

The committee mode provides comprehensive multi-perspective analysis at the cost of additional time (~15 minutes vs ~3 minutes solo).
