# PRD Evolution Command

Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) using an advanced multi-agent committee workflow. This command leverages 4 specialized AI agents (DevOps Architect, Lead Developer, UX Designer, Product Owner) plus CTO arbitration to produce high-quality, consensus-driven PRDs through a structured 2-round collaborative process.

## Usage
```
/doh:prd-evo <natural language description>
```

## Examples
- `/doh:prd-evo gitlab support`
- `/doh:prd-evo add OAuth2 authentication to the API`
- `/doh:prd-evo version 2.0 database migration`
- `/doh:prd-evo user-notifications`

## Agents
- **Committee Orchestrator**: `.claude/agents/committee-orchestrator.md`
- **DevOps Architect**: `.claude/agents/devops-architect.md`
- **Lead Developer**: `.claude/agents/lead-developer.md`
- **UX Designer**: `.claude/agents/ux-designer.md`
- **Product Owner**: `.claude/agents/product-owner.md`

## Instructions

### 1. Initial Context Gathering

From `$ARGUMENTS`, begin understanding the feature request, but first gather project context:

**Silently check (don't announce these checks):**
1. Read `VERSION` file to understand current version
2. Check `.doh/versions/` for planned versions and roadmap
3. List `.doh/prds/` to see existing PRDs and avoid duplication
4. Check `.doh/epics/` for related work in progress

### 2. Comprehensive Discovery Phase (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS conduct a thorough discovery session before suggesting parameters:**

```
üèõÔ∏è Let's create a collaborative PRD for: "$ARGUMENTS"

The Committee Evolution process uses 4 specialized agents to create comprehensive PRDs:
‚Ä¢ üèóÔ∏è DevOps Architect (security, scalability, infrastructure)
‚Ä¢ üíª Lead Developer (technical architecture, implementation)
‚Ä¢ üé® UX Designer (user experience, accessibility, design)
‚Ä¢ üíº Product Owner (business requirements, market fit)

Before we start the committee session, I need to understand the full context:

1. **What problem does this solve?**
   - Who are the primary users affected?
   - What pain points does it address?
   - Why is this important now?

2. **What's the scope and goal?**
   - Core functionality needed?
   - Expected outcomes?
   - Success metrics?

3. **Where does this fit in the roadmap?**
   - Is this a bug fix, new feature, or breaking change?
   - Should this target an existing version or need a new one?
   - Dependencies on other features?

4. **Any constraints or considerations?**
   - Technical limitations?
   - Timeline requirements?
   - Security/performance needs?

Please provide context on these points (answer what you can, skip what's not relevant).
```

### 3. Intelligent Parameter Synthesis

After gathering context, synthesize the information using the same logic as `/doh:prd-new`:

**Determine Feature Name:**
- **MUST capture the main idea/purpose** (not just literal conversion)
- Convert to meaningful kebab-case that conveys intent
- Examples of good naming:
  - "gitlab support" ‚Üí `gitlab-integration` (not just "gitlab-support")
  - "fix login bugs" ‚Üí `auth-stability` (captures the goal)
  - "make it faster" ‚Üí `performance-optimization` (descriptive of purpose)
  - "add users page" ‚Üí `user-management` (broader feature context)
- Ensure it's unique and check against existing PRDs
- Should be self-documenting (someone should understand the feature from the name)

**Craft Description:**
- Concise summary (max 100 chars) that expands on the name
- Captures the business value and outcome
- Complements the feature name with additional context

**Analyze Version Impact:**
Based on discovery answers, determine:
- **Patch (x.y.Z+1)**: Bug fixes, minor improvements
- **Minor (x.Y+1.0)**: New features, backwards compatible
- **Major (X+1.0.0)**: Breaking changes, major features

**Check existing versions:**
```bash
# Check if suitable version exists
ls -la .doh/versions/
```

If no suitable version exists, suggest creating one first.

### 4. Present Comprehensive Understanding (MANDATORY)

**Show full context before starting committee session:**

```
üèõÔ∏è Committee PRD Planning Summary for "$ARGUMENTS"
=================================================

**Understanding of the Feature:**
${SUMMARIZE_PROBLEM_AND_SOLUTION}

**Proposed PRD Parameters:**
   Feature name: ${FEATURE_NAME}
   Description: ${DESCRIPTION}
   Target version: ${TARGET_VERSION} (${VERSION_REASONING})

**Committee Assessment:**
   - Complexity: ${HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW}
   - User impact: ${DESCRIPTION}
   - Breaking changes: ${YES/NO}
   - Dependencies: ${LIST_OR_NONE}
   - Committee duration: ~15 minutes (vs ~3 minutes solo)

**Agent Focus Areas:**
   - üèóÔ∏è DevOps: Infrastructure, security, scalability concerns
   - üíª Lead Dev: Technical architecture, implementation feasibility
   - üé® UX: User experience, accessibility, design consistency
   - üíº PO: Business requirements, market fit, success metrics

**Roadmap Alignment:**
   - Current version: ${CURRENT_VERSION}
   - Fits in version: ${TARGET_VERSION}
   - Related PRDs: ${LIST_OR_NONE}
   - Related epics: ${LIST_OR_NONE}

**Key Requirements Identified:**
   ${BULLET_LIST_OF_KEY_REQUIREMENTS}

Is this understanding correct? Should I proceed with committee session?
1. ‚úÖ Yes, start committee PRD creation
2. üìù Let me provide more context
3. ‚úèÔ∏è Adjust the parameters
4. üìã Create a new version first
5. ‚ö° Use solo mode instead (faster, simpler)
```

### 5. Handle User Response

Based on user choice:

**Option 1 (Proceed with Committee):**
- Continue to validation and committee session

**Option 2 (More context):**
- Ask specific follow-up questions
- Refine understanding
- Present updated summary

**Option 3 (Adjust):**
```
Which parameters need adjustment?
- Feature name (current: ${FEATURE_NAME})
- Description (current: ${DESCRIPTION})  
- Target version (current: ${TARGET_VERSION})
- Other aspects of scope/requirements

Please provide the corrections.
```

**Option 4 (New version):**
- **DELEGATE to version command**: Execute `/doh:version-new for ${FEATURE_NAME} - ${DESCRIPTION}`
- **Let version-new handle:** Version number inference, discovery, and creation
- After version creation completes, return to PRD creation with the created version
- DO NOT manually create version files or specify version numbers

**Option 5 (Solo mode fallback):**
- **DELEGATE to prd-new command**: Execute `/doh:prd-new ${ARGUMENTS}`
- Present option with reasoning: "Committee mode provides more comprehensive analysis but takes longer. Solo mode is faster for simple features."

### 6. Pre-Committee Validation

**After confirmation, silently validate:**

1. **Check PRD doesn't exist:**
   ```bash
   [ -f ".doh/prds/${FEATURE_NAME}.md" ]
   ```
   If exists: "‚ö†Ô∏è PRD '${FEATURE_NAME}' already exists. Options:
   - Edit existing: /doh:prd-edit ${FEATURE_NAME}
   - Use different name
   - Overwrite (loses content)"

2. **Validate feature name:**
   - Must be kebab-case
   - Must start with letter
   - No special characters

3. **Verify target version exists (if specified):**
   ```bash
   [ -f ".doh/versions/${TARGET_VERSION}.md" ]
   ```
   If not: 
   ```
   Version ${TARGET_VERSION} doesn't exist yet.
   
   Should I create it for you?
   1. ‚úÖ Yes, create version ${TARGET_VERSION}
   2. üîÑ Choose a different version
   3. ‚ùå Cancel PRD creation
   ```
   
   If user agrees, **DELEGATE**: `/doh:version for ${FEATURE_NAME} - ${DESCRIPTION}`

### 7. Committee Session Execution

**After user confirmation, launch committee-orchestrator with Task tool:**

```
üèõÔ∏è Starting Committee PRD Session...
=====================================

Feature: ${FEATURE_NAME}
Description: ${DESCRIPTION}
Target Version: ${TARGET_VERSION}

Launching committee orchestrator...
```

**Use Task tool to launch committee-orchestrator agent:**

The committee-orchestrator agent will:
1. Use ./.claude/scripts/doh/helper.sh committee create ${FEATURE_NAME} to initialize session
2. Execute Round 1: Use Task tool to launch 4 parallel agents (devops-architect, lead-developer, ux-designer, product-owner) 
3. Use committee.sh functions to collect ratings and manage feedback
4. Execute Round 2: Use Task tool again for agent revisions based on feedback
5. Perform convergence analysis and create final PRD
6. Use ./.claude/scripts/doh/helper.sh to save final PRD to .doh/prds/${FEATURE_NAME}.md

**Task invocation:**
```
subagent_type: committee-orchestrator
prompt: Execute complete committee PRD workflow for "${FEATURE_NAME}".

Context:
- Feature: ${FEATURE_NAME}  
- Description: ${DESCRIPTION}
- Target Version: ${TARGET_VERSION}
- Problem: ${PROBLEM_SUMMARY}
- Scope: ${SCOPE_SUMMARY}
- Requirements: ${REQUIREMENTS_LIST}

Use existing DOH committee infrastructure:
- helper.sh committee commands for session management
- committee.sh library for workflow coordination  
- Task tool for agent coordination (devops-architect, lead-developer, ux-designer, product-owner)
- Save final PRD in standard DOH format to .doh/prds/${FEATURE_NAME}.md
```

### 8. Post-Committee Processing

After committee session completes, validate and enhance results:

**Check committee output:**
```bash
# Verify committee session completed
[ -d "committees/${FEATURE_NAME}" ]
[ -f ".doh/prds/${FEATURE_NAME}.md" ]
```

**Present results:**
```
‚úÖ Committee PRD Session Complete
=================================

**Created:** .doh/prds/${FEATURE_NAME}.md
**Session Details:** committees/${FEATURE_NAME}/
**Duration:** ${ACTUAL_DURATION} minutes
**Agents Participated:** 4 specialized agents + CTO arbitration

**Committee Insights:**
‚Ä¢ üèóÔ∏è DevOps concerns: ${DEVOPS_KEY_POINTS}
‚Ä¢ üíª Lead Dev insights: ${LEADDEV_KEY_POINTS}  
‚Ä¢ üé® UX considerations: ${UX_KEY_POINTS}
‚Ä¢ üíº PO requirements: ${PO_KEY_POINTS}

**Consensus Level:** ${CONVERGENCE_SCORE}
**Key Decisions:** ${COMMITTEE_DECISIONS}

The PRD incorporates multi-perspective analysis and cross-functional alignment.
```

### 9. Final Summary

```

## Important Rules

1. **UNDERSTAND FIRST** - Never start committee without comprehensive context
2. **ROADMAP AWARENESS** - Always check versions and existing work  
3. **USER CONFIRMATION** - Explicit approval required before committee session
4. **COMMITTEE ORCHESTRATOR** - Always use `.claude/agents/committee-orchestrator.md` for session management
5. **CONTEXT PRESERVATION** - Pass complete discovery context to committee
6. **EXACT PARAMETERS** - Maintain same parameter standards as /doh:prd-new
7. **VALIDATE EVERYTHING** - Check names, versions, duplicates before committee
8. **VERSION DELEGATION** - NEVER manually create version files; always use `/doh:version-new`

## Error Handling

- If committee session fails, offer fallback to solo mode
- Present committee session minutes for debugging
- Enable session recovery for interrupted committees  
- Suggest `./.claude/scripts/doh/helper.sh committee help` for committee issues
- If version doesn't exist, **DELEGATE to /doh:version** 
- If PRD exists, never overwrite without explicit confirmation

## Committee vs Solo Mode

**Use Committee Mode When:**
- Complex cross-functional features
- Security-sensitive implementations
- User-facing functionality changes
- Multi-system integrations
- Unclear technical requirements

**Consider Solo Mode For:**
- Simple bug fixes or minor improvements
- Well-defined technical tasks
- Urgent timeline requirements
- Prototype or experimental work

The committee mode provides comprehensive multi-perspective analysis at the cost of additional time (~15 minutes vs ~3 minutes solo).
