# /doh:version-status

## Description
Display the current DOH project version and show progress toward planned versions with task completion metrics.

## Usage
```
/doh:version-status
```

## Implementation
The AI agent will:
1. Read current version from VERSION file at project root
2. Find all planned versions from `.doh/versions/`
3. For each planned version:
   - Count PRDs/epics/tasks targeting this version
   - Calculate completion percentage
   - Show blocking items
4. Display version roadmap

## Output Format
