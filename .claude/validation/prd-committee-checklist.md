- [x] Phase tracking (draft, feedback, cto, checkpoint)
- [x] User feedback storage

### Feedback Template

- [x] Structured rating format
- [x] Example provided

## ✅ Workflow Phases

### Per Round Execution

2. [x] **Phase 2**: Feedback collection (agents review each other)
3. [x] **Phase 3**: CTO analysis (market opportunities)
4. [x] **Phase 4**: User checkpoint & pause

### Session Continuation
- [x] Load session.yaml
- [x] Determine current round/phase
- [x] Resume from saved state
- [x] Continue to next round

## ✅ Integration Points

### With DOH Ecosystem
- [x] Creates standard PRD in `.doh/prds/`
- [x] Compatible with `/doh:prd-parse` for epic creation
- [x] Version system integration
- [x] Uses DOH helper functions

### Error Handling
- [x] Check for existing PRDs
- [x] Validate session exists for continue
- [x] Missing session.yaml detection
- [x] Recovery options on failure

## ⚠️ Fixed Issues

1. **Seed template location**: Changed from referencing old orchestration to inline template
2. **Session.yaml structure**: Created template in `.claude/templates/`
3. **Feedback template**: Moved to `.claude/templates/` (not in old orchestration)

## 🎯 Validation Result

**Status: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

All critical components are defined and validated:
- Simple 3-round sequential workflow
- Clear agent leadership per round
- Mandatory pauses with continuation support
- Proper templates without old system dependencies
- Integration with DOH ecosystem maintained

The command successfully replaces the complex `prd-evo` with a simpler, more reliable `prd-committee` approach.
