T103 Integration Hook
===================

Usage: integration-hook.sh COMMAND [args]

Commands:
  notify FILE TOOL RULE TYPE     - Notify about manual intervention opportunity
  log FILE TOOL RULE PATTERN     - Quick log automated intervention
  check                          - Show learning statistics
  proposals                      - Check for plugin proposals

Integration Examples:

# From lint-files.sh when manual fix needed:
integration-hook.sh notify "docs/README.md" "markdownlint" "MD013" "line_length"

# From automated correction detection:  
integration-hook.sh log "docs/README.md" "markdownlint" "MD013" "long_line_detected"

# Regular learning checks:
integration-hook.sh check
integration-hook.sh proposals
