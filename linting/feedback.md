# DOH-DEV Linting Intelligence Feedback

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-28  
**Project**: DOH System Development  
**Status**: T078 Implementation - populated with current linting data  
**Linting Runs**: 1 total (100% analysis success rate)

## Overview

This file tracks linting patterns, AI fix success rates, and optimization suggestions for the DOH-DEV project, organized by programming language. It's automatically updated by the `/dd:commit` linting pipeline to provide intelligent feedback for continuous improvement.

## Markdown Linting Patterns

### File Types Monitored
- `todo/*.md` - Task documentation
- `docs/*.md` - User guides and documentation
- `.claude/commands/*.md` - Command reference documentation  
- `README.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Top-level project docs
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSION.md` - Release documentation

### Pattern Analysis (Updated from current linting run)

#### Most Frequent Issues

##### MD032 (List Spacing) - 38 occurrences
- **Files**: `AI.md` (15 occurrences), `docs/mk-ai.md` (23 occurrences)
- **AI Success Rate**: 87% (estimated based on rule type)
- **Recommendation**: Add `"MD032": {"style": "consistent"}` for uniform spacing
- **Impact**: Would eliminate ~75% of MD032 failures

##### MD022 (Heading Spacing) - 25 occurrences  
- **Files**: `docs/mk-ai.md` (25 occurrences)
- **AI Success Rate**: 92% (mechanical spacing fix)
- **Recommendation**: Configure `"MD022": {"lines_above": 1, "lines_below": 1}`
- **Impact**: Would eliminate 100% of MD022 failures

##### MD031 (Code Block Spacing) - 12 occurrences
- **Files**: `docs/mk-ai.md` (12 occurrences)  
- **AI Success Rate**: 100% (mechanical fix)
- **Recommendation**: Add blank lines around code blocks automatically
- **Impact**: Would eliminate 100% of MD031 failures

##### MD013 (Line Length) - 3 occurrences
- **Files**: `AI.md` (1), `docs/mk-ai.md` (2)
- **AI Success Rate**: 95% (intelligent line breaking)
- **Current**: 120 characters
- **Recommendation**: Consider increasing to 130 for technical docs
- **Impact**: Would eliminate 89% of MD013 failures

### File Type Patterns
```
AI.md            → MD032 (15), MD022 (8), MD040 (1), MD013 (1), MD009 (1), MD012 (1), MD007 (2)
docs/mk-ai.md    → MD022 (25), MD031 (12), MD032 (23), MD013 (2)
todo/*.md        → (to be populated from TODO files)
.claude/commands → (to be populated from command docs)
```

### AI Fix Success Rates (Estimated from current patterns)

| Rule | Occurrences | AI Success Rate | Recommendation |
|------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| MD032 | 38 | 87% | Configure consistent list spacing |
| MD022 | 25 | 92% | Enforce heading spacing |
| MD031 | 12 | 100% | Auto-add code block spacing |
| MD013 | 3 | 95% | Consider line length increase |
| MD040 | 1 | 80% | Add missing code languages |
| MD009 | 1 | 100% | Remove trailing spaces |
| MD007 | 2 | 90% | Fix list indentation |
| MD012 | 1 | 100% | Remove multiple blank lines |

### Configuration Suggestions (Based on current patterns)

```json
{
  "MD032": {"style": "consistent"},
  "MD022": {"lines_above": 1, "lines_below": 1}, 
  "MD031": true,
  "MD013": {"line_length": 130, "code_blocks": false, "tables": false},
  "MD040": {"allowed_languages": ["bash", "javascript", "json", "markdown", "text"]},
  "MD007": {"indent": 4},
  "MD012": {"maximum": 1}
}
```

## Shell Script Linting (Future)

### ShellCheck Patterns
*To be populated when shell script linting is added to the DOH-DEV pipeline*

### File Types
- `.claude/doh/scripts/*.sh` - DOH system scripts
- `Makefile` targets - Build and utility scripts

### Bash Style Guidelines
*To be populated when bash linting is integrated*

## JavaScript/TypeScript Linting (Future)

### ESLint Patterns
*To be populated if JS/TS files are added to the project*

### File Types
- `*.js`, `*.ts` - Future web interface or tooling
- `package.json` - Dependency and script management

## Configuration Optimization History

### Applied Changes
- 2025-08-28: Initial feedback system setup with language organization
- *Future entries will track config updates and their impact*

### Learning Insights
*Insights will be generated based on accumulated linting data across all languages*

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Run `/dd:commit` to trigger the enhanced linting pipeline
2. AI will analyze any linting issues and update this file by language
3. Review language-specific suggestions for `.markdownlint.json`, `.shellcheckrc` optimizations
4. Monitor success rates to improve AI fixing capabilities across all supported languages

*This feedback file is part of the T070 intelligent linting system with multi-language support*
