# PM Team Session - Test Feature Planning

**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Command**: `/dd:pm-team "plan authentication system"`  
**Technical Project Owner**: David  

## Feature Request

**Input**: "Plan authentication system for DOH project"

**Context**:
- DOH is a development workflow management system
- Target users: developers using Claude.ai for project management  
- Current state: No authentication, considering adding user accounts for personalized workflows
- Technical stack: Node.js, file-based systems, CLI-focused

**Strategic Questions for PM Team**:
- Should we implement authentication for DOH v1.4.0 or defer to v2.0?
- What's the primary value proposition for users?
- How does this integrate with DOH's current file-based approach?
