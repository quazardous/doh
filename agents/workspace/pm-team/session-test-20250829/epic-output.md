Enable secure, developer-friendly authentication for DOH system using GitHub OAuth 2.0 with local profile storage,
creating foundation for personalized AI-driven development workflows while maintaining DOH's fast, offline-capable CLI
experience.

## User Stories (PO Agent Analysis)

### **Core Authentication Experience**

- **DD098**: GitHub OAuth 2.0 Integration
  - **As a developer using DOH**, I want to log in with my GitHub account so that I can access personalized workflows
    without creating another account
  - **As a developer**, I want the login process to be fast and familiar so that authentication doesn't slow down my
    development workflow
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] GitHub OAuth device flow integration for CLI authentication
    - [ ] Login process completes in <30 seconds with clear progress indication
    - [ ] Token storage encrypted locally for security
    - [ ] Automatic token refresh without user intervention
    - [ ] Clear error messages for authentication failures

### **Seamless Profile Management**

- **DD099**: Local Profile Storage and Management
  - **As a developer**, I want my DOH preferences saved locally so that I have consistent experience without depending
    on internet connection
  - **As a developer**, I want to manage my profile settings easily so that I can customize DOH to my workflow
    preferences
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] Encrypted profile storage at `~/.doh/profile.json`
    - [ ] Profile includes user identity, preferences, and usage patterns
    - [ ] Profile management commands (`/dd:profile`, `/dd:logout`)
    - [ ] Graceful fallback to anonymous mode if profile corrupted/missing
    - [ ] Profile data never transmitted without explicit user consent

### **Enhanced Personalization**

- **DD100**: User Preference Integration
  - **As a developer**, I want DOH to remember my task prioritization preferences so that `/dd:next` gives me personally
    relevant recommendations
  - **As a developer**, I want my completed task patterns remembered so that DOH gets better at suggesting what I should
    work on next
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] User preferences integrated into existing DOH commands
    - [ ] `/dd:next` recommendations personalized based on user patterns
    - [ ] Task completion history tracked for pattern analysis
    - [ ] Preference categories: priority levels, task types, work patterns
    - [ ] Easy preference reset to defaults if needed

### **Backward Compatibility & Reliability**

- **DD101**: Authentication Integration and Fallback
  - **As a current DOH user**, I want all existing functionality to work exactly the same whether I'm logged in or not
  - **As a developer working offline**, I want DOH to work normally even when authentication services are unavailable
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - [ ] All existing `/dd:*` commands work identically without authentication
    - [ ] No performance degradation for core DOH functionality
    - [ ] Automatic fallback to anonymous mode on auth failures
    - [ ] Clear indication of authentication status in relevant commands
    - [ ] Seamless upgrade path from current file-based DOH usage

## Technical Implementation (Lead Dev Agent Assessment)

### **Architecture Decisions**

- **Authentication Method**: GitHub OAuth 2.0 using device flow (CLI-optimized)
- **Profile Storage**: Local encrypted JSON at `~/.doh/profile.json`
- **Security Model**: Local-first with minimal data transmission
- **Integration Pattern**: Optional authentication context in existing commands
- **Performance Target**: <100ms authentication check per command invocation

### **Implementation Structure**

```javascript
// Profile schema
{
  "user": {
    "id": "github_123456",
    "provider": "github",
    "name": "David",
    "avatar_url": "https://...",

  }
}
```

### **Technical Task Breakdown**

#### **DD098: GitHub OAuth 2.0 Integration (4 hours)**

- **OAuth Device Flow**: CLI-appropriate authentication without embedded browser
- **Token Management**: Secure local token storage with automatic refresh
- **API Integration**: GitHub user profile retrieval and validation

- **Security**: HTTPS only, minimal scope requests, secure token storage

#### **DD099: Local Profile Storage (2 hours)**

- **Encryption Layer**: Profile data encrypted using system-appropriate methods
- **File Management**: Atomic writes, backup/recovery, corruption detection
- **Profile Schema**: Extensible JSON structure for user data and preferences
- **Access Layer**: Clean API for profile read/write operations across DOH
- **Migration**: Smooth transition from current anonymous usage to profiles

#### **DD100: User Preference Integration (1.5 hours)**
