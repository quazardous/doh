### Completed in This Session (2025-08-29)

- **DD087** - Simplified Linting Architecture with STRICT Enforcement Rule (DOH-DEV Internal)
  - **STATUS**: ✅ COMPLETED 2025-08-29
  - **Project**: DOH-DEV Internal (dd-x.x.x versioning)
  - **Components**: Removed 4-layer AI-powered linting pipeline from `/dd:changelog` (527→89 lines, -83% reduction),
    implemented STRICT enforcement rule in `/dd:commit` (linting failure = commit blocked, period), created unified
    script architecture with `dev-tools/scripts/lint-files.sh`, established hybrid architecture for `/dd:lint` command
    with unified backend + AI enhancement
  - **Impact**: Dramatically simplified linting workflow from complex dual-system to single enforcement point, reduced
    `/dd:changelog` complexity by 83% to focus purely on documentation, unified all linting through single backend
    script, established clear and predictable developer experience
  - **Architecture**: Single enforcement point through pre-commit hooks only, complete removal of AI-powered pipeline
    linting, unified script backend for all commands, clean `--force` flag for explicit bypass scenarios
  - **Files Updated**: `.claude/commands/dd/changelog.md`, `.claude/commands/dd/commit.md`,
    `.claude/commands/dd/lint.md`, `dev-tools/scripts/lint-files.sh`, `dev-tools/lib/lint-core.sh`,
