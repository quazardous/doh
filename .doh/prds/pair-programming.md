# PRD: AI Pair Programming as Default Standard for DOH Framework

## Executive Summary

Transform DOH to make pair programming the DEFAULT standard for all issue handling. Every issue automatically initiates a driver-navigator pair session, with solo work requiring explicit justification. This paradigm shift recognizes that collaborative AI development consistently produces superior code quality, faster delivery, and better architectural decisions than isolated agent work.

## Problem Statement

Current AI development workflows are fundamentally solitary:
- Single agent works on each task in isolation
- No real-time code review or collaborative problem-solving
- Missing the benefits of pair programming: knowledge transfer, bug prevention, better design decisions
- Human developers lose pair programming benefits when working with AI

The DOH framework's parallel execution capability creates an opportunity to pioneer true AI pair programming.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
1. **Establish pair programming as the default method for all issue handling**
2. Enable seamless collaboration between AI agents using driver-navigator pattern
3. Implement automatic pairing with opt-out rather than opt-in workflow
4. Create comprehensive tracking and metrics for all paired work
5. Demonstrate measurable superiority of paired development over solo work

### Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: 100% of issues use pairing by default (solo requires justification)
- **Quality**: 40% reduction in bugs for paired issues vs historical solo baseline
- **Efficiency**: 25% faster implementation across all issue types
- **Coverage**: 95% test coverage as standard (vs 80% solo baseline)
- **Compliance**: < 5% of issues opt-out to solo mode
- **Satisfaction**: 90% developer preference for paired AI assistance

## User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want all my issues to automatically use pair programming
- I want to opt-out to solo ONLY when I have a valid reason
- I want to see which agent is driving vs navigating at any time
- I want rotations to happen automatically without my intervention
- I want full session history and decision rationale

### As a Team Lead
- I want pair programming to be the enforced default
- I want to review justifications for any solo work
- I want metrics comparing paired vs solo performance
- I want to ensure critical code NEVER skips pairing

### As an AI Agent
- I expect to always work in pairs unless explicitly told otherwise
- I need clear role definitions and responsibilities
- I need seamless context sharing with my pair
- I need to coordinate without conflicts
- I need to learn optimal pairing patterns over time

## Proposed Solution

### Core Philosophy: Pair Programming as Default

**Pair programming becomes the standard approach for ALL issue handling in DOH.** This fundamental shift recognizes that collaborative development produces superior outcomes and should be the default, not the exception.

- Session metrics in all reports
- Pairing effectiveness dashboard

#### Phase 3: Continuous Improvement (Week 3)
- ML-based pairing optimization
- Pattern recognition for best pairings
- Performance analytics by pair combinations
- Learning from pair patterns across projects

## Technical Requirements

### Command Integration (No Separate Pair Commands)

Since pair programming is the DEFAULT, it's integrated into existing commands. **ALL development commands support `--solo --reason` for opt-out:**

```bash
# Issue Development (pairing by default)
/doh:issue-start <num>                          # Starts with pair programming
/doh:issue-start <num> --solo --reason "hotfix" # Opt-out requires justification
/doh:issue-analyze <num>                        # Analyzes with pairing in mind

# Epic Development (all spawned agents pair)
/doh:epic-start <name>                          # Each issue gets paired agents
/doh:epic-start <name> --solo --reason "POC"    # All agents work solo
/doh:epic-start-worktree <name>                 # Worktree variant with pairing
/doh:epic-decompose <name>                      # Decomposes with paired approach

# PRD Development (paired brainstorming)
/doh:prd-new <name>                             # Paired brainstorming session
/doh:prd-new <name> --solo --reason "draft"     # Solo ideation
/doh:prd-parse <name>                           # Technical planning in pairs

# Convenience Commands (inherit pairing)
/doh:epic-oneshot <name>                        # Propagates pairing to sub-commands

# Status & Monitoring (show pairing info)
/doh:issue-status <num>                         # Shows driver/navigator & rotation
/doh:status                                      # Dashboard with pairing metrics
/doh:standup                                     # Includes pairing effectiveness
```

**Key Design Decisions**: 
- No `/doh:pair-*` commands - pairing IS the standard mode
- No manual rotation commands - rotations are fully automated
- `--solo` flag REQUIRES `--reason` for accountability
- Flag propagates to all spawned sub-agents
- Solo justifications logged and reviewable

### File Structure
```
.doh/
├── epics/
│   └── {epic}/
│       ├── issues/
│       │   └── {issue}.md      # Now includes pairing section
│       └── pairing/
│           ├── {issue}-session.md    # Active session state
│           ├── {issue}-history.json  # Role rotations, decisions
│           └── {issue}-metrics.json  # Performance data
├── context/
│   ├── pairing-patterns.md     # Learned pairing patterns
│   └── solo-justifications.log # Audit trail of all solo work
```

**Solo Justification Tracking:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-30T10:00:00Z",
  "command": "/doh:issue-start 1234",
  "issue": 1234,
  "reason": "urgent production hotfix",
  "approved": true,
  "duration": "45min",
  "outcome": "success"
}
```

**Integration Note**: Pairing data lives alongside issue data, not in separate directory, reinforcing that pairing IS the standard workflow. Solo work is the exception and is tracked for review.

### Agent Types
- `pair-coordinator`: Manages pairing session
- `pair-driver`: Focused implementation agent
- `pair-navigator`: Review and research agent

### GitHub Integration
- `pair-programming` label
- Co-authored commits
- Session tracking in issue comments
- Pairing metrics in PR description

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. Synchronous Real-time Pairing
- **Pros**: True simultaneous collaboration
- **Cons**: Complex coordination, high latency, context window limits
- **Decision**: Start with async, move to sync later

### 2. Three-Agent Model (Driver, Navigator, Observer)
- **Pros**: Better documentation, quality assurance
- **Cons**: Context overhead, coordination complexity
- **Decision**: Keep as future enhancement

### 3. Swarm Programming (3+ agents)
- **Pros**: Massive parallelism
- **Cons**: Exponential coordination complexity
- **Decision**: Focus on pairs first

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Context window overflow | High | Separate contexts per agent, sync at checkpoints |
| Role confusion | Medium | Clear role definitions, visual indicators |
| Merge conflicts | Medium | Use worktrees, coordinate through locks |
| Performance overhead | Low | Async coordination, efficient handoffs |
| Agent disagreement | Medium | Escalation to human, voting mechanism |

## Open Questions

1. Should pairing be mandatory for certain issue types?
2. How to handle timezone/availability for async pairing?
3. Should we support human-AI pairing initially?
4. What's the optimal rotation interval?
5. How to measure "compatibility" between agents?

## Appendix

### Example Pairing Session

```markdown
# Pairing Session: Issue #1234
Started: 2025-01-30T10:00:00Z
Mode: driver-navigator
Rotation: 30min

## 10:00 - Session Start
Driver: Agent-1 (implementing auth service)
Navigator: Agent-2 (reviewing security patterns)

## 10:15 - Navigator Suggestion
"Consider using bcrypt instead of SHA256 for password hashing"
Driver: Accepted, implementing change

## 10:30 - Role Rotation
Driver: Agent-2 (writing tests)
Navigator: Agent-1 (reviewing test coverage)

## 11:00 - Session Complete
Result: Feature implemented with 98% coverage
Bugs prevented: 3
Review suggestions: 7 (5 accepted)
```

### Pairing Effectiveness Formula

```
Effectiveness = (Bugs_Prevented × 3 + Time_Saved × 2 + Coverage_Increase × 1) / Session_Duration
```

Where:
- Bugs_Prevented: Issues caught by navigator
- Time_Saved: vs estimated solo time
- Coverage_Increase: % above baseline
- Session_Duration: Total pairing time
