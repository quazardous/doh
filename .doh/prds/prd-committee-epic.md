# PRD: Committee Epic Decomposition - Collaborative Epic Breakdown

## Executive Summary

Transform the `/doh:prd-parse` process from solo breakdown to a **multidisciplinary committee** that negotiates technical breakdown, business prioritization, implementation roadmap, and **simple proof-driven milestones**. The same 4-agent committee (DevOps, Lead Dev, UX, PO) + CTO applies their complementary expertise to create robust, prioritized, and technically coherent epics with **objective checkpoints** that require easily demonstrable progress, preventing tunnel development and documentation theater.

## Problem Statement

### Current Problem with `/doh:prd-parse`
- **Mono-perspective breakdown**: Single agent transforms PRD into technical epic
- **Arbitrary prioritization**: No business vs technical vs UX negotiation
- **Late-discovered tensions**: Development phase conflicts emerge during implementation
- **Sub-optimal architecture**: No cross-validation of technical and business choices
- **No milestone validation**: Epics lack objective checkpoints to prove real progress
- **Tunnel development risk**: Teams work in isolation without demonstrable interim value
- **Documentation theater**: Teams produce complex reports instead of working demonstrations
- **Proof complexity**: Evidence requires extensive analysis instead of simple validation

### Example of Unresolved Tensions
```
DevOps: "Must start with infrastructure and pipelines"
Lead Dev: "Backend first, stable APIs, then frontend"  
UX: "Quick prototype to validate user journeys"
PO: "Critical features first for time-to-market"
```

### Why Now?
The PRD Committee has proven its value for **collaborative creation**. The logical next step is applying this **collective expertise to breakdown** for better structured and consensual epics.

## User Stories

### As a Product Manager
- I want my epics to integrate **business prioritization** AND **technical constraints**
- I want to see the **negotiations** between time-to-market and technical robustness
- I want the **implementation roadmap** validated by all expertise areas
- I want **task dependencies** identified upfront

### As a Tech Lead

- I want to negotiate **UX quick wins** vs robust development

### As a Developer
- I want to receive **well-structured epics** with clear dependencies
- I want the **task order** negotiated between all expertise areas
- I want to avoid **architecture refactors** discovered during development

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR1: Committee Epic Decomposition Process

**`/doh:prd-parse` Integration**:
- **Default**: `/doh:prd-parse feature` launches breakdown committee
- **Opt-out**: `/doh:prd-parse feature --solo --reason "simple feature"`
- **Input**: Existing PRD (created solo or by committee)
- **Output**: Structured epic with consensual roadmap

#### FR2: 5-Phase Workflow

**Phase 1: Input Collection**
- üíº **PO**: Gathers user needs and economic opportunities
- üé® **UX**: Identifies user journeys and pain points
- üíª **Lead Dev**: Evaluates feasibility and technical complexity
- üèóÔ∏è **DevOps**: Verifies robustness, architecture, maintainability

**Phase 2: Prioritization and Breakdown**
- Committee classifies needs by: **business impact + user value + feasibility**
- Decision on coherent feature set vs necessary sub-epics
- **Trade-off** and **sequencing** negotiation

**Phase 3: Initial Writing**
- Standardized epic format with:
  - Clear title
  - Objective/value
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Dependencies/technical constraints

**Phase 4: Technical and Architecture Validation**
- **Lead Dev + DevOps** validate feasibility and technical roadmap alignment
- **Cross-challenge** of implementation choices

**Phase 5: Final CTO Validation**
- **CTO** validates strategic alignment
- **Human escalation** if persistent disagreements
- Finalized epic ready for `/doh:epic-decompose`

#### FR3: Typical Tension Negotiation

**DevOps vs Lead Dev**:
```
DevOps: "Infrastructure first - environments then code"
Lead: "Stable backend APIs before any development"
Resolution: Parallel infra + backend phases with defined contracts
```

**UX vs PO**:
```
UX: "Prototypes for user validation before heavy development"
PO: "Critical business features in absolute priority"
Resolution: Quick-win prototypes + critical features in parallel
```

**PO vs DevOps**:
```
PO: "Time-to-market, fast iterative deliveries"
DevOps: "Robust architecture, clean migrations"
Resolution: Phases with successive MVPs on solid architecture
```

#### FR4: Enriched Epic Structure

**Epic generated with negotiated sections**:
```markdown
# Epic: Feature-Name

## Collaborative Vision
- **Business** (PO): Opportunities and ROI
- **UX** (Designer): Priority user journeys  
- **Technical** (Lead): Architecture and stack
- **Infrastructure** (DevOps): Deployment and robustness

## Negotiated Roadmap with Milestones
### Phase 1: Infrastructure + API Contracts (2 weeks)
- [DevOps Lead] Environment setup
- [Lead Dev] Backend API definition
- [UX] High-fidelity wireframes
- [PO] Business model validation

**üéØ Milestone 1: "Foundation Ready"**
- **Simple Proof**: Live demo of API endpoints responding + deployment dashboard green
- **Evidence Format**: 
  - Quick screencast: Environment deployment + API test
  - 1 screenshot: Performance dashboard showing scalability metrics
  - 3 annotated wireframes: UX approval with user feedback
- **Validation**: Committee mini-review
- **Pass Criteria**: Can demo working foundation easily and clearly

### Phase 2: Core Features (3 weeks)  
- [Lead Dev] Backend implementation
- [UX] Frontend prototype
- [DevOps] CI/CD pipelines
- [PO] User testing

**üéØ Milestone 2: "Feature Complete"**
- **Simple Proof**: User completes entire flow without assistance
- **Evidence Format**:
  - Short video: Real user completing core feature flow
  - Test dashboard: 95% pass rate with green metrics
  - 3 screenshots: Before/during/after user interaction
- **Validation**: Committee review
- **Pass Criteria**: Feature works for real users, proven visually

### Phase 3: Polish + Go-Live (1 week)
- [ALL] Optimizations and monitoring

**üéØ Milestone 3: "Production Ready"**
- **Simple Proof**: Live production system handling real load
- **Evidence Format**:
  - Quick screencast: Production deployment + real traffic
  - Monitoring dashboard: All systems green under load
  - Performance snapshot: Key metrics meeting targets
- **Validation**: Final committee approval
- **Pass Criteria**: System proven working in production with real users
```

#### FR5: Simple Proof-Driven Milestones

**Easy-Proof Checkpoint System**:
- **Every epic phase ends with a mandatory milestone**
- **Each milestone requires easily understandable proof** (no 100-page reports)
- **Committee mini-reviews validate achievement**
- **Failed milestones block progression** to next phase

**Simple Proof Standard**:
```yaml
milestone:
  name: "Foundation Ready"
  phase: 1
  proof_format:
    demo_video: "Brief screencast showing working system"
    key_metrics: "3 green dashboard metrics"
    visual_evidence: "Max 3 annotated screenshots"
    user_feedback: "Simple thumbs up/down from real users"
  validation:
    committee_review: "Quick review session"
    proof_clarity: "Mom test - can non-technical person understand?"
    required_votes: "3/4 agents"
  pass_criteria:
    easy_understanding: "Evidence clear and simple to grasp"
    working_demo: "System actually works, not just planned"
    user_validated: "Real users can use it successfully"
```

**Anti-Documentation-Theater Protection**:
- **No complex reports accepted** - working demos only
- **"Show, don't tell" principle** enforced
- **Committee rejects verbose evidence** - demands simplicity
- **If you can't demo it simply and clearly, it's not done**

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR1: Process Performance
- **Total duration < 20 minutes** (vs 5-8 min solo breakdown)
- **Negotiation timeouts**: 5 min max per phase
- **Parallel sessions** when possible (input collection)

#### NFR2: Decision Quality  
- **All tensions** identified and resolved before finalization
- **Cross-dependencies** validated between phases
- **Coherent roadmap** with team capacities

#### NFR3: Proof Simplicity
- **All milestone evidence easily understandable**
- **No document > 1 page** accepted as proof
- **Video demos kept short and clear**
- **Screenshots limited to 3** per milestone
- **Committee review efficient and focused**

#### NFR4: Traceability
- **Prioritization arguments** documented
- **Negotiated compromises** historized
- **Technical decisions** justified

## Technical Approach

### `/doh:prd-parse` Extension

**Modified command**:
```bash
# Committee mode with milestones (new default)
/doh:prd-parse feature

# Solo mode (opt-out)  
/doh:prd-parse feature --solo --reason "simple CRUD"

# Explicit committee mode
/doh:prd-parse feature --committee
```

**New Milestone Commands**:
```bash
# Milestone management during epic execution
/doh:milestone-check epic-name milestone-1    # Validate milestone achievement
/doh:milestone-review epic-name milestone-1   # Committee mini-review
/doh:milestone-status epic-name              # Show all milestone progress
/doh:milestone-proof epic-name milestone-1   # Collect required proofs

# Integration with existing workflow
/doh:epic-status epic-name                   # Now includes milestone progress
/doh:next-milestone                          # Show next milestone due
```

    'ux': ['user_value', 'experience_quality', 'usability'],  
    'lead': ['technical_feasibility', 'maintainability', 'performance'],
    'devops': ['scalability', 'security', 'operational_excellence']
}

# Weighted negotiation by expertise
final_priority = weighted_consensus(priorities, domain_weights)
```

## Concrete Examples

### Example 0: Simple Proof Standards by Domain

#### API Milestone Proof:
```yaml
‚úÖ ACCEPTED:
- Quick Postman demo: All endpoints respond well
- 1 screenshot: Test dashboard showing 47/47 tests passing
- Performance metric: 1000 concurrent users handled

‚ùå REJECTED:
- 50-page API documentation

- 1 dashboard screenshot: All monitoring metrics green
- Load test result: "1000 users OK" with timestamp

‚ùå REJECTED:
- Infrastructure architecture documents
- Detailed deployment logs
- Complex infrastructure analysis
```

### Example 1: SaaS Authentication Epic

**PRD Input**: Authentication system for multi-tenant SaaS

**Phase 1 - Inputs**:
- **PO**: "JWT + OAuth2, enterprise SSO integration, per-user pricing"
- **UX**: "Smooth mobile login, frictionless onboarding, password reset UX"
- **Lead**: "Spring Security + Redis sessions, REST APIs, rate limiting"  
- **DevOps**: "Vault for secrets, auth monitoring, user backups"

**Phase 2 - Negotiation**:
```
PO: "Enterprise SSO priority 1 - big contracts"
UX: "Mobile UX first - 70% mobile traffic"  
Lead: "Stable auth backend before complex SSO"
DevOps: "Security and Vault from phase 1"

Consensus: Phase 1 = Auth core + mobile UX, Phase 2 = Enterprise SSO
```

**Final Epic**: 3 balanced phases business + technical + UX

### Example 2: Resolved Infrastructure vs Features Tension

**Conflict**:
- DevOps: "Complete Kubernetes infrastructure before development"
- PO: "Critical features in production within 6 weeks"

**CTO Resolution**: 
- Phase 1: MVP Infrastructure (Docker + simple CI) + Core features
- Phase 2: Kubernetes migration + Advanced features  
- Compromise: Fast delivery on evolutionary infrastructure

## Epic-to-Issues Integration with `/doh:epic-decompose`

### Milestone-Driven Task Placement

**Challenge**: How does `/doh:epic-decompose` place individual GitHub issues according to milestone structure?

**Solution**: **Milestone-aware task breakdown** that automatically groups issues by milestone phases.

#### Epic Structure After Committee
```markdown
# Epic: Authentication System

## Phase 1: Foundation (Milestone: "Auth Core Ready")
- Backend auth API endpoints
- Database user schema  
- JWT token system
- Basic password validation

## Phase 2: UX Integration (Milestone: "User Flow Complete")
- Login/signup frontend
- Password reset flow
- Mobile responsive design
- Error handling UX

## Phase 3: Enterprise Features (Milestone: "Enterprise Ready")
- OAuth2/SSO integration
- Multi-tenant support
- Admin user management
- Audit logging
```

#### How `/doh:epic-decompose` Processes This

**Input**: Epic with milestone phases
**Output**: GitHub issues tagged and sequenced by milestones

```bash
# Issues generated with milestone tags
/doh:epic-decompose auth-epic

# Creates issues:
Issue #1: [M1-Foundation] Setup user database schema
Issue #2: [M1-Foundation] Implement JWT auth endpoints  
Issue #3: [M1-Foundation] Add password validation logic
Issue #4: [M2-UX] Create login frontend component
Issue #5: [M2-UX] Build password reset flow
Issue #6: [M3-Enterprise] Integrate OAuth2 providers
```

#### Milestone Dependency Logic

**Sequential Milestones**: Issues auto-blocked by milestone dependencies
```yaml
Issue #4: [M2-UX] Create login frontend
  depends_on: [1, 2]  # M1 foundation issues
  milestone_blocked_until: "M1-Foundation" 
  
Issue #6: [M3-Enterprise] OAuth2 integration  
  depends_on: [1, 2, 4, 5]  # M1 + M2 issues
  milestone_blocked_until: "M2-UX"
```

**Parallel Work Within Milestones**: Issues in same milestone can be parallel
```yaml
Issue #1: [M1-Foundation] Database schema
Issue #2: [M1-Foundation] JWT endpoints  
Issue #3: [M1-Foundation] Password validation
# These 3 can be worked simultaneously - no inter-dependencies
```

#### Special Tag: `[PROOF-FRAMEWORK]` Issues

**Problem**: Validation framework issues (tests, demos, monitoring) don't fit cleanly in milestone phases.

**Solution**: Special `[PROOF-FRAMEWORK]` tag for validation infrastructure.

```bash
# Regular milestone issues
Issue #1: [M1] Setup user database schema
Issue #2: [M1] Implement JWT auth endpoints  

# Proof framework issues - each attached to specific milestone
Issue #7: [MP1] Setup API test suite for auth endpoints
Issue #8: [MP2] Create user journey test automation  
Issue #9: [MP3] Build performance monitoring dashboard
Issue #10: [MP1] Setup demo environment deployment
```

**Proof Framework Characteristics**:
```yaml
Issue #7: [MP1] Setup API test suite
  purpose: "Enable M1 milestone validation"
  validates_milestone: "M1"
  priority: "HIGH - blocks M1 validation"
  parallel_to: "M1 feature issues [1,2,3]"
  
Issue #8: [MP2] User journey test automation
  purpose: "Enable M2 milestone validation"  
  validates_milestone: "M2"
  priority: "HIGH - required for M2 proof"
  depends_on: [1, 2, 7]  # Needs M1 features + MP1 framework
```

**Development Strategy**:
- **Start MP1 early** - parallel to M1 feature work
- **MP issues are HIGH PRIORITY** - they unblock milestone validation
- **Committee validates MP framework** before accepting milestone evidence

**Example Timeline**:
```
Week 1: M1 features + MP1 framework
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Issue #1: [M1] Database schema  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Issue #2: [M1] JWT endpoints
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Issue #7: [MP1] API test suite ‚Üê CRITICAL for M1 validation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Issue #10: [MP1] Demo environment ‚Üê CRITICAL for M1 validation

Week 2: M1 completion validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Run Issues #7,#10 against Issues #1,#2 (MP1 validates M1)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Collect M1 proof using MP1 framework
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Committee validates M1 ‚Üí unlocks M2

Week 3: M2 features + MP2 framework  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Issue #4: [M2] Login frontend
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Issue #5: [M2] Password reset  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Issue #8: [MP2] User journey automation ‚Üê CRITICAL for M2 validation
```

**Clear Milestone-Proof Pairing**:
- M1 features validated by MP1 issues
- M2 features validated by MP2 issues  
- M3 features validated by MP3 issues

**No Cross-Milestone Proof Pollution**: Each milestone has its own validation framework.

#### Integration Points

**1. Epic File Structure**
```
.claude/epics/auth-system/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ epic.md                    # Committee-generated epic with milestones

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 6.md                   # [M3] Tagged with milestone
```

**2. Enhanced `/doh:epic-decompose` Workflow**
```bash
# Step 1: Parse epic milestones  
parse_milestone_phases(epic.md)

# Step 2: Generate issues per milestone
for each milestone:
  create_issues_for_milestone_tasks()
  
# Step 3: Set milestone dependencies
for each issue:
  if issue.milestone > 1:
    add_dependency_on_previous_milestone_completion()
    
# Step 4: GitHub integration
create_github_issues_with_milestone_labels()
setup_milestone_blocking_dependencies()
```

**3. Milestone Validation Integration**
```bash
# Before starting M2 issues - validate M1 completion
/doh:milestone-check auth-system M1-foundation

# If M1 not proven complete -> block M2 issues
# If M1 proven complete -> unblock M2 issues automatically
```

#### Benefits for Development Teams

**Clear Progress Visualization**:
- Issues automatically organized by milestone phases  
- Can't work on M2 issues until M1 proven complete
- Prevents jumping ahead without proper foundation

**Reduced Context Switching**:
- Team focuses on one milestone at a time
- All M1 issues visible together for coordinated work  
- Clear milestone completion triggers next phase

**Automatic Progress Tracking**:
- Milestone completion % calculated from issues
- DOH can report: "M1: 3/3 issues complete + proof validated = M2 unlocked"
- Project managers see real progress, not just code commits
