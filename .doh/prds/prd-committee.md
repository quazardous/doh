# PRD: Multi-Agent Committee for Collaborative PRD Creation

## Executive Summary

Transform PRD creation from a solo process to a **multidisciplinary committee of 4 specialized agents** (DevOps, Lead Dev, UX, PO) with CTO validation. **2 iterative rounds** with cross-rating, contradictory debates, and convergence toward superior quality PRDs integrating all business perspectives.

## Problem Statement

### Current Problems
- **Mono-perspective PRDs**: Single agent creates PRD, lacks holistic vision
- **Late-discovered tensions**: DevOps vs Dev vs UX vs Business conflicts emerge during implementation
- **Inconsistent quality**: PRDs without specific domain expertise (security, UX, market)
- **Sub-optimal decisions**: No upstream idea confrontation

### Why Now?
The DOH framework with specialized agents finally enables **simulating a complete product team** to create robust PRDs with all business expertise from conception.

## User Stories

### As a Product Manager
- I want my PRD to **automatically integrate** DevOps, technical, UX and business expertise
- I want to see the **debates and arbitrations** between different perspectives
- I want **technical tensions** identified before implementation
- I want to **make final decisions** when agents can't converge

### As a Developer
- I want PRDs to include **real technical constraints** from conception
- I want **architecture choices** debated upfront
- I want to avoid **UX surprises** or **DevOps constraints** discovered during development

### As a Tech Lead
- I want my **technical choices** confronted with other concerns
- I want to negotiate **trade-offs** between velocity and robustness
- I want **technical feasibility** properly evaluated

### As a DevOps Engineer
- I want **security and deployment concerns** integrated from spec stage
- I want **pipelines and monitoring** considered in architecture
- I want to defend **robustness** against speed demands

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### FR1: Multi-Agent Committee
**4 specialized agents** with defined roles:
- üèóÔ∏è **DevOps Architect**: Robustness, security, infrastructure, deployments
- üíª **Lead Developer**: Technology choices, patterns, state-of-the-art
- üé® **UX Designer**: User experience, journeys, mobile-first, accessibility
- üíº **Product Owner**: Market, ROI, business opportunities, SaaS vs standalone
- **CTO Agent**: Validation, arbitration, technical and business challenge

#### FR2: 2-Round Process

**Round 1 - Exploration:**
1. **Separate drafting**: Each agent produces their PRD version
2. **Cross-rating**: Agents rate others (1-5 ‚≠ê) with arguments
3. **CTO feedback**: Challenge and tension identification

**Round 2 - Convergence:**
4. **Revision**: Agents revise based on CTO feedback and constraints
5. **Final rating**: New rating on revised versions
6. **Delivery**: Consolidated PRD or human escalation if divergence

#### FR3: Rating and Consensus System
- **1-5 scores** with mandatory justification
- **Convergence calculation**: If gap < threshold ‚Üí auto validation
- **Divergence handling**: CTO presents options ‚Üí human decides

#### FR4: Complete Historization
- **Session minutes** for each round
- **Successive versions** of PRDs by agent
- **Detailed arguments and scores**
- **Identified tensions** and resolutions
- **CTO decisions** and rationale

#### FR5: DOH Integration
- **Default**: `/doh:prd-new feature` launches committee
- **Opt-out**: `/doh:prd-new feature --solo --reason "prototype"`
- **Compatibility**: Same output as existing PRDs
- **Workflow**: PRD ‚Üí `/doh:prd-parse` ‚Üí Standard epic

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### NFR1: Performance
- **Complete process < 15 minutes** (vs 3-5 min solo PRD)
- **Parallel sessions** when possible
- **Timeouts** on infinite debates

#### NFR2: Quality
- **Traceable arguments** for each decision
- **Consistency** between final PRD sections
- **Completeness**: All business perspectives covered

#### NFR3: Usability
- **Transparency**: User sees the process
- **Minimal intervention**: Human escalation only when necessary
- **Understanding**: Accessible minutes and rationale

- **Satisfaction**: 85% developer preference for committee vs solo PRDs
- **Discovery**: 80% technical tensions identified before development
- **Time**: Process stabilized to < 10 minutes with experience

## Technical Approach

### Agent Architecture

#### DevOps Architect Agent
```yaml
personality: Rigorous, security-focused, long-term
concerns:
  - "Proper migration even if longer"
  - "Separate BO from frontend with clean APIs"
  - "Secure pipelines mandatory"
tensions:
  - vs Lead Dev: "Secure deliveries vs velocity"
  - vs PO: "Robustness vs time-to-market"
```

#### Lead Developer Agent
```yaml
personality: Pragmatic, technical, solution-oriented
concerns:
  - "Vue.js + Symfony for this spec"
  - "State-of-the-art and best practices"
  - "Realistic technical feasibility"
tensions:
  - vs DevOps: "These pipelines are painful"
  - vs UX: "Complexity of your demands"
```

#### UX Designer Agent
```yaml
personality: User-centric, creative, experience quality
concerns:
  - "Mobile-first but not only"
  - "Smooth Progressive Web App"
  - "Accessibility and ergonomics"
tensions:
  - vs Lead Dev: "Feasibility vs UX vision"
  - vs PO: "Experience vs features"
```

#### Product Owner Agent
```yaml
personality: Business-oriented, market-focused, ROI-driven
concerns:
  - "Multi-tenant SaaS = huge market"
  - "Critical time-to-market"
  - "Economic opportunities"
tensions:
  - vs DevOps: "Velocity vs architecture"
  - vs UX: "Features vs pretty"
```

#### CTO Agent
```yaml
personality: Arbitrator, strategic, balanced
responsibilities:
  - Technical AND business challenge
  - Tension identification
  - Compromise proposals
  - Escalation when necessary
```

### Rating System

```python
# Scores by agent
scores = {
    'devops': [4, 5, 3],    # Ratings given to others
    'lead': [5, 2, 4],
    'ux': [3, 3, 5],
    'po': [4, 4, 3]
}

# Convergence calculation
convergence_threshold = 1.0
if max_score_difference < convergence_threshold:
    consensus = True
else:
    escalate_to_cto()
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Specialized Agents (Week 1)
- Develop 4 agents with distinct personalities
- Test realistic tensions and debates
- Validate business perspective quality

### Phase 2: 2-Round Process (Week 2)
- Implement complete workflow
- Rating and convergence system
- CTO agent and arbitration

### Phase 3: DOH Integration (Week 3)
- Modify `/doh:prd-new` for default committee
- Historization and minutes
- Complex PRD testing

### Phase 4: Optimization (Week 4)
- Convergence threshold tuning
- Performance and timeouts
- User feedback

## Example Sessions

### Example 1: SaaS vs Standalone Tension

**Round 1:**
- **PO**: "Multi-tenant SaaS = 10x bigger market"
- **DevOps**: "Complex migration, necessary splitting"
- **Lead**: "OK but requires Symfony multi-tenant + Vue.js"
- **UX**: "Admin + user interface, mobile mandatory"

**CTO Feedback**: "PO is right about market, but DevOps don't underestimate complexity. Lead, why not Laravel? UX, mobile-first but not full PWA in v1."

**Round 2**: Revisions and compromises ‚Üí Balanced PRD

### Example 2: Quick Consensus

**Round 1**: Convergent scores (gap < 1)
**Result**: Automatic validation without round 2

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Existing DOH agent framework
- Task system for parallel agents
- Storage for session historization

### Process Dependencies
- Agent personality definitions
- Convergence threshold calibration
- User training on escalation

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Compatibility**: Same output as current PRDs
- **Performance**: Max 15 min vs 5 min solo PRD
- **Maintenance**: Stable agent personalities

### Assumptions
- Users accept extra time for quality
- Simulated tensions are representative
- 4 agents sufficient (no need for Legal, Finance, etc.)

## Out of Scope

### V1 Exclusions
- **Human agents** in committee (100% AI)
- **Slack/Teams integration** for notifications
- **ML/Learning** of user preferences
- **Cross-validation** with real product team
- **Quantitative metrics** of PRD quality

### Future Considerations
- **Security Agent** for sensitive features
- **Legal Agent** for GDPR compliance
- **GitHub integration** for PRD reviews
- **PRD templates** by business domain
