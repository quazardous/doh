# Version 0.5.0 - Core Versioning Foundation with AI Planning

## Overview
Comprehensive versioning system release combining foundational version management capabilities with AI-powered strategic planning features.

## Must Have Features (Foundation)
- VERSION file as single source of truth
- Basic version bump commands (patch/minor/major)
- Frontmatter version field support
- Version library API functions
- Git tag integration
- Semantic version validation and compliance checking

## Must Have Features (AI-Powered)
- AI-powered version creation with natural language input
- AI-powered version editing and updates
- Intelligent target_version suggestions during PRD creation
- Strategic version file format with goal categorization
- Natural language processing for version planning

## Should Have Features
- Enhanced PRD creation workflow with version integration
- Automatic version compatibility checking
- AI-generated strategic content for version files
- Seamless handoff between version planning and PRD creation
- Interactive version creation flow

## Must Not Have Features
- Complex bash scripting for version commands
- Technical implementation details in version files
- Rigid structured input requirements
- Breaking changes to existing DOH workflows

## Release Conditions
This version will be automatically proposed for release when ALL of the following conditions are met:

### Required Tasks (Foundation)
- [ ] 005 - Create frontmatter integration
- [ ] 006 - Version bump workflow implementation

### Required Tasks (AI Features)
- [ ] 022 - AI-powered version planning commands
- [ ] `/doh:version-new` working as pure AI command
- [ ] `/doh:version-edit` functional with natural language processing
- [ ] `/doh:prd-new` enhanced with AI version suggestions

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Tests passing for implemented features
- [ ] Basic documentation complete
- [ ] VERSION file in use
- [ ] All AI commands tested and validated
- [ ] Strategic version file format established
- [ ] Integration with DOH workflow confirmed

## Success Criteria
- AI commands understand conversational natural language
- Version files maintain strategic, goal-oriented focus
- PRD creation suggests appropriate target versions automatically
- No manual scripting required for version operations
- Full integration with existing DOH library functions

## Breaking Changes
None - Backwards compatible release

## Migration Guide
For projects adopting the versioning system:
1. Create VERSION file at project root with current version
2. Remove hardcoded versions from documentation
3. Start using version library functions
4. Begin using AI-powered version commands for strategic planning

## Strategic Focus
This version introduces both foundational versioning infrastructure and AI-powered strategic planning to DOH, enabling product managers to describe version goals in natural language while maintaining robust technical version management capabilities.

## Known Limitations
- Version milestones not fully integrated
- Graph dependencies for versions not implemented

## Release Notes
[Will be automatically generated from completed tasks when conditions are met]

## Next Steps
After 0.5.0 release:
- Implement version milestone conditions (Task 007)
- Add version dependencies to graph (Task 008)
- Complete full automation for 1.0.0
