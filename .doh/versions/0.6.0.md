# Version 0.6.0 - Command Architecture Refactoring

## Global Goal
Refactor DOH command architecture to use modular helper scripts and the frontmatter library API, transforming commands into thin orchestration layers for improved maintainability and code reuse.

## Must Have
- [ ] Helper directory structure in `.claude/scripts/doh/helper/`
- [ ] Helper bootstrap mechanism (`helper.sh`)
- [ ] All DOH commands refactored to use helper pattern
- [ ] Frontmatter library API used for all markdown creation
- [ ] Backwards compatibility maintained for all commands

## Should Have
- [ ] Helper test coverage
- [ ] Domain-based helper organization
- [ ] Performance benchmarks showing no regression
- [ ] Documentation for helper pattern usage

## Must Not Have
- Breaking changes to existing command interfaces
- Performance degradation from current implementation
- Manual frontmatter construction in commands
- Commands with embedded bash scripts over 10 lines
