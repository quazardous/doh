# Version 2.0.0

## Overview
Major release introducing a provider plugin architecture for Version Control System (VCS) abstraction, enabling support for multiple platforms beyond GitHub.

## Goals
- Introduce provider plugin architecture for VCS abstraction
- Add full GitLab integration with feature parity to GitHub
- Implement configuration system for provider selection
- Maintain backward compatibility through configuration

## Features
- **GitLab Integration**: Complete GitLab API support matching current GitHub functionality
- **Provider Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for adding new VCS providers
- **Configuration Management**: `.doh/` configuration for provider selection and settings
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Ability to work with GitHub, GitLab, and future providers

## Breaking Changes
- New configuration format required in `.doh/` directory
- Provider must be explicitly configured (defaults to GitHub for compatibility)
- Some commands may have provider-specific behaviors

## Migration Guide
- Existing projects will need to add provider configuration
- Default provider will be GitHub to maintain compatibility
- Configuration migration tool will be provided

## Success Metrics
- Full feature parity between GitHub and GitLab providers
- Clean plugin architecture allowing easy addition of new providers
- Zero regression in existing GitHub functionality
- Clear migration path for existing users
