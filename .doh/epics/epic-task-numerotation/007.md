# Task: Frontmatter number field updates

## Description

Add 'number' field to epic.md and task frontmatter templates. Update the frontmatter.sh script to handle number fields during file creation and modification. Ensure the DOH library auto-populates numbers during epic and task creation. Support parent field for hierarchical references, enabling tasks to reference their parent epic numbers.

This task focuses on integrating the numbering system into the existing frontmatter management infrastructure, making number assignment seamless and automatic for users.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add 'number' field to epic.md frontmatter template
- [ ] Add 'number' field to task frontmatter template  
- [ ] Update `frontmatter.sh` to handle number field processing
- [ ] Modify epic creation workflow to auto-populate number field
- [ ] Modify task creation workflow to auto-populate number field
- [ ] Add parent field support for hierarchical task-epic relationships
- [ ] Update frontmatter validation to include number field requirements
- [ ] Ensure number fields are properly formatted (e.g., zero-padded 3-digit format)
- [ ] Integration with numbering library for automatic number assignment
- [ ] Backward compatibility with existing epic and task files

## Technical Details

### Frontmatter Schema Updates:
```yaml
# Epic frontmatter
---
name: Epic Name
number: 001
status: active
created: 2025-08-31T16:07:07Z
updated: 2025-08-31T16:07:07Z

# Task frontmatter
---
name: Task Name
number: 007
parent: 001
status: open
created: 2025-08-31T16:07:07Z
updated: 2025-08-31T16:07:07Z

```

### Functions to Update:
- `update_frontmatter()` - Add number field handling
- `validate_frontmatter()` - Include number field validation
- `create_epic_frontmatter()` - Auto-populate number from registry
- `create_task_frontmatter()` - Auto-populate number and parent fields

### Integration Points:
- Epic creation commands must call numbering library
- Task creation commands must reference parent epic number
- File naming should align with number assignment (e.g., 007.md)

## Dependencies

This task depends on task 006 (Epic and task creation integration) which provides the integration points between the CLI commands and the numbering system.

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: M (Medium)  
**Hours**: 8-10 hours

### Breakdown:
- Frontmatter template updates: 2 hours
- frontmatter.sh script modifications: 4 hours
- Integration with numbering library: 2 hours
- Testing and validation: 2 hours

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Number fields are automatically populated during creation
- [ ] Frontmatter validation includes number field checks
- [ ] Parent-child relationships work correctly between epics and tasks
- [ ] Existing files remain compatible (no breaking changes)
- [ ] Integration tests pass with CLI commands
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Manual testing confirms seamless user experience
