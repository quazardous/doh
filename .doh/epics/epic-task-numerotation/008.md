# Task: Documentation and testing suite

## Description

Create comprehensive documentation in `.claude/rules/` covering the entire numbering system architecture, usage patterns, and best practices. Develop a complete testing suite that covers concurrent access scenarios, cache recovery mechanisms, and migration scenarios. Include performance benchmarks to ensure the system scales appropriately.

This task can run in parallel with task 007 since it focuses on documentation and testing rather than core implementation, but it depends on tasks 001-006 for the foundational components to document and test.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete architecture documentation in `.claude/rules/numbering-system.md`
- [ ] User guide documentation in `.claude/rules/numbering-usage.md`
- [ ] API reference documentation for all numbering library functions
- [ ] Testing scripts for concurrent access scenarios
- [ ] Cache recovery testing suite
- [ ] Migration scenario test scripts
- [ ] Performance benchmark suite
- [ ] Error handling and edge case documentation
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Integration examples and best practices guide

## Technical Details

### Documentation Structure:
```
.claude/rules/
├── numbering-system.md          # Architecture overview
├── numbering-usage.md           # User guide and examples
├── numbering-api.md             # API reference
├── numbering-troubleshooting.md # Common issues and solutions
└── numbering-testing.md         # Testing strategy and tools
```

### Testing Suite Components:
```
.claude/scripts/doh/tests/
├── concurrent-access-test.sh    # Multi-process numbering tests
├── cache-recovery-test.sh       # Registry corruption and recovery
├── migration-test.sh            # Version upgrade scenarios
├── performance-benchmark.sh     # Load and performance testing
├── integration-test.sh          # End-to-end workflow testing
└── unit-tests/                  # Individual function tests
    ├── numbering-lib-test.sh
    ├── registry-test.sh
    └── validation-test.sh
```

### Performance Benchmarks:
- Number generation speed under load
- Registry access times with varying sizes
- Concurrent access handling efficiency
- File locking overhead measurements
- Memory usage patterns during operations

### Test Scenarios:
- Multiple processes creating epics/tasks simultaneously
- Registry file corruption and automatic recovery
- Migration from systems without numbering
- Large project with thousands of epics and tasks
- Network storage and distributed team scenarios

## Dependencies

This task depends on tasks 001-006 which provide all the foundational components that need to be documented and tested:
- Core numbering library (001)
- Registry management system (002)
- CLI integration points (003)
- Migration utilities (004)
- Cache management (005)
- Epic and task creation integration (006)

## Effort Estimate

**Size**: L (Large)  
**Hours**: 14-18 hours

### Breakdown:
- Architecture and usage documentation: 6 hours
- API reference and troubleshooting guides: 3 hours
- Concurrent access testing suite: 4 hours
- Migration and recovery testing: 3 hours
- Performance benchmarking: 2 hours
- Integration testing and validation: 2 hours
