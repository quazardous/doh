# Task 042: Validate test isolation effectiveness

## Objective
Comprehensively validate that test isolation prevents all writes to actual project data.

## Validation Strategy
1. **Pre-test state capture**: Record current ~/.doh/ state
2. **Run full test suite** with isolation enabled
3. **Post-test verification**: Confirm ~/.doh/ unchanged
4. **Temporary directory audit**: Verify test artifacts created in temp dirs only

## Test Coverage
- [ ] All existing tests run successfully with isolation
- [ ] No new files created in ~/.doh/
- [ ] No modifications to existing registry files
- [ ] All temporary directories cleaned up
- [ ] Test results remain consistent with isolation enabled

## Performance Testing
- [ ] Test execution time with isolation vs without
- [ ] Memory usage of temporary directories
- [ ] Cleanup efficiency after test failures

## Edge Case Testing
- [ ] Tests that fail mid-execution (cleanup validation)
- [ ] Multiple test runs in parallel
- [ ] Tests that create large amounts of data

## Success Criteria
- 100% test isolation effectiveness
- Zero artifacts in actual project directories
- No performance degradation >10%
- Reliable cleanup under all conditions

## Dependencies
- Task 038: Research complete
- Task 039: Function naming fixed
- Task 040: Test framework isolation implemented
- Task 041: Project ID override implemented
