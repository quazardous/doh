# Task 043: Clean up existing test pollution and document isolation

## Objective
Clean up existing test pollution in development environments and create comprehensive documentation for the test isolation system.

## Cleanup Tasks
1. **Remove polluted registry**: Delete `~/.doh/projects/doh_c9a3caf9/` with 200+ test entries
2. **Clean test artifacts**: Remove any orphaned test files and directories
3. **Reset registry state**: Ensure clean registry for development work

## Documentation Tasks
1. **Developer guide**: How test isolation works internally
2. **Test author guide**: How to write tests with isolation (transparent)
3. **Library documentation**: Environment variables supported by each library
4. **Troubleshooting guide**: Common isolation issues and fixes
