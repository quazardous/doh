# Epic: prd-committee

## Overview
Implementation of a multi-agent collaborative PRD creation system through a NEW `/doh:prd-evo` command (keeping existing `/doh:prd-new` unchanged). Creates sophisticated 4-agent committee with specialized roles (DevOps, Lead Dev, UX, PO) plus CTO validation through a 2-round iterative process with cross-rating and convergence mechanisms.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Agent Framework Extension**: Build upon existing DOH agent system with 4 specialized agent personalities
- **File-Based Session Storage**: Use structured markdown files under `.claude/committees/{feature}/` for complete audit trail
- **Convergence Algorithm**: Mathematical threshold-based consensus detection with automatic CTO escalation
- **Dual Command Approach**: New `/doh:prd-evo` command alongside existing `/doh:prd-new` (unchanged)
- **Output Compatibility**: Same PRD format as existing system, works with `/doh:prd-parse`

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **New Command Creation**: Create `/doh:prd-evo` command with committee workflow
- **Progress Visualization**: Real-time session progress display during 2-round process
- **Escalation Interface**: User decision prompts when CTO agent detects irreconcilable differences

### Backend Services
- **Agent Personality Engine**: 4 specialized agents with distinct perspectives and programmed tensions
- **Session Orchestrator**: Manage 2-round workflow with parallel agent drafting and sequential rating
- **Convergence Calculator**: Implement threshold algorithm to detect consensus vs escalation
- **CTO Agent**: Meta-analysis agent for arbitration and technical/business challenge validation
- **Session Historian**: Complete audit trail storage with versioned PRD drafts and decision rationale

### Infrastructure
- **File Structure Management**: Automated creation of committee session directories
- **Performance Optimization**: Parallel agent execution where possible, timeout mechanisms for infinite debates
- **Integration Testing**: Validate compatibility with existing `/doh:prd-parse` and epic workflows

## Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Develop 4 specialized agents with realistic personalities and tension generation
- **Phase 2**: Implement 2-round workflow engine with rating system and convergence detection
- **Phase 3**: Build CTO agent with sophisticated arbitration logic and escalation triggers
- **Phase 4**: Create `/doh:prd-evo` command and integrate with existing DOH workflows
- **Phase 5**: Performance optimization and timeout implementation

## Task Breakdown Preview
High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] **Agent Development**: Create 4 specialized agents with distinct personalities and domain expertise
- [ ] **Session Engine**: Build 2-round workflow orchestrator with rating collection and convergence detection
- [ ] **CTO Agent**: Implement sophisticated arbitration system with escalation logic
- [ ] **File Structure**: Design and implement committee session storage system
- [ ] **Command Creation**: Create new `/doh:prd-evo` command with committee workflow (keeping `/doh:prd-new` unchanged)
- [ ] **Performance Systems**: Add timeout mechanisms and parallel processing optimization
- [ ] **Testing & Validation**: Comprehensive testing of agent interactions and workflow edge cases

## Dependencies
- Existing DOH agent framework and command system
- Current PRD creation workflow and file formats
- GitHub CLI integration for future epic synchronization
- Agent task execution capabilities from existing system

## Success Criteria (Technical)
- **Agent Quality**: 4 agents generate genuinely different perspectives with realistic professional tensions
- **Convergence Accuracy**: 80% of sessions reach consensus within threshold without human escalation
- **Performance**: Complete process under 15 minutes (vs 3-5 minutes for solo PRD creation)
- **Compatibility**: 100% compatibility with existing `/doh:prd-parse` and epic workflows
- **Adoption**: Functional `/doh:prd-evo` command alongside existing `/doh:prd-new` (dual approach)
- **Audit Trail**: Complete session historization with traceable decision rationale
