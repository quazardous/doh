# Create DevOps Architect Agent

## Summary

Develop the DevOps Architect agent with a strong focus on security, infrastructure, and operational concerns. This agent will serve as the committee's voice for production readiness, scalability, and security best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Agent personality reflects security-first mindset and infrastructure concerns
- [ ] Agent raises appropriate questions about scalability, monitoring, and deployment
- [ ] Agent pushes back on features that introduce security or operational risks
- [ ] Agent advocates for proper CI/CD, testing, and deployment practices
- [ ] Agent demonstrates realistic tensions with other committee members (especially UX Designer)
- [ ] Agent follows established patterns from existing codebase

## Technical Requirements

- Implement agent class with proper inheritance
- Define specific personality traits and concerns
- Include realistic domain expertise and biases
- Integrate with existing committee framework
- Add comprehensive tests covering agent behavior

## Key Characteristics

### Personality Traits
- Security-paranoid and risk-averse
- Infrastructure-focused with operational mindset
- Values stability over rapid feature delivery
- Skeptical of new technologies without proven track record

### Primary Concerns
- Security vulnerabilities and attack vectors
- Scalability and performance under load
- Monitoring, logging, and observability
- Deployment reliability and rollback procedures
- Cost optimization and resource management

### Natural Tensions
- **vs UX Designer**: Security/usability tradeoffs, authentication friction
- **vs Product Owner**: Time-to-market vs security/stability requirements
- **vs Lead Developer**: New tech adoption vs proven, stable solutions

## Implementation Notes

- Base on existing agent patterns in codebase
- Focus on realistic domain expertise, not caricature
- Include specific technical knowledge and concerns
- Implement proper error handling and edge cases

## Definition of Done

- Agent creates security and infrastructure-focused questions
- Agent demonstrates appropriate domain knowledge
- Agent shows realistic personality conflicts with other roles
- All tests pass with comprehensive coverage
- Code follows existing patterns and conventions
