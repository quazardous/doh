# Task: Create helper infrastructure and bootstrap mechanism

## Description
Set up the foundational helper infrastructure including directory structure, bootstrap script, and conventions for helper organization and invocation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Helper directory structure created at `.claude/scripts/doh/helper/`
- [ ] Helper bootstrap script (`helper.sh`) implemented with domain/action pattern
- [ ] Helper can route calls to appropriate domain scripts
- [ ] Error handling for missing domains/actions
- [ ] Basic helper template/example created

## Technical Details
- Create `.claude/scripts/doh/helper/` directory structure
- Implement `helper.sh` to accept: `helper.sh <domain> <action> [args]`
- Support domain organization (epic/, prd/, task/, version/, etc.)
- Include help/usage functionality
- Ensure proper error codes and messages

**IMPORTANT**: Read [docs/writing-good-scripts.md](docs/writing-good-scripts.md) for complete helper architecture documentation including function patterns, usage rules, and implementation examples.

## Dependencies
- [ ] No dependencies - this is the foundation task

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-6
- Parallel: false (blocks other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Helper directory structure created
- [ ] Bootstrap script functional
- [ ] Can invoke: `helper.sh epic create` (even if just returns "not implemented")
- [ ] Documentation for helper pattern added
- [ ] Code reviewed
