# Task: Implement version domain helper with new/show functions

## Description
Create the version domain helper that handles version management, bumping, and display operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Version helper created at `.claude/scripts/doh/helper/version/`
- [ ] Supports `helper.sh version new <version>` for version setting
- [ ] Supports `helper.sh version show [file]` for version display
- [ ] Supports `helper.sh version bump <type>` for version increments
- [ ] Uses version API for all version operations
- [ ] Proper error handling and validation

## Technical Details
**IMPORTANT**: Read [docs/writing-good-scripts.md](docs/writing-good-scripts.md) for complete helper implementation patterns.
- Create `.claude/scripts/doh/helper/version/` directory
- Implement new.sh for version setting
- Implement show.sh for version display and comparison
- Implement bump.sh for version incrementing
- Use `./.claude/scripts/doh/api.sh version` for all version ops
- Use `./.claude/scripts/doh/api.sh frontmatter` for file operations
- Extract logic from existing version commands

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Helper infrastructure must be complete

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8
- Parallel: true (can run alongside other domain helpers)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Version helper scripts created
- [ ] Can successfully manage versions
- [ ] Uses version API exclusively
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
