# Task: Implement version domain helper with new/show functions

## Description
Create the version domain helper that handles version management, bumping, and display operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Version helper created at `.claude/scripts/doh/helper/version.sh`
- [x] Supports `helper.sh version new <version>` for version setting
- [x] Supports `helper.sh version show [file]` for version display
- [x] Supports `helper.sh version bump <type>` for version increments
- [x] **NEW: Supports `helper.sh version update <version> field:value [field:value...]`**
- [x] Uses version API for all version operations
- [x] Proper error handling and validation

## Technical Details
**IMPORTANT**: Read [docs/writing-good-scripts.md](docs/writing-good-scripts.md) for complete helper implementation patterns.
- Create `.claude/scripts/doh/helper/version/` directory
- Implement new.sh for version setting
- Implement show.sh for version display and comparison
- Implement bump.sh for version incrementing
- Use `./.claude/scripts/doh/api.sh version` for all version ops
- Use `./.claude/scripts/doh/api.sh frontmatter` for file operations
- Extract logic from existing version commands

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Helper infrastructure must be complete

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8
- Parallel: true (can run alongside other domain helpers)

## Definition of Done
- [x] Version helper scripts created
- [x] Can successfully manage versions
- [x] **NEW: Can update version fields via `helper_version_update()` using `frontmatter_update_many()`**
- [x] Uses version API exclusively
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed

## Update Functionality Examples (COMPLETED)
```bash
# Library API - Direct file operations
./.claude/scripts/doh/api.sh version update /path/to/version.md "type:release" "notes:Major feature release"

# Helper API - Entity-based operations  
./.claude/scripts/doh/helper.sh version update "1.2.0" "status:released" "notes:Bug fixes and improvements"

# Multi-field updates in one call
helper_version_update "0.6.0" "type:pre-release" "status:testing" "release_date:2025-09-15"
```
