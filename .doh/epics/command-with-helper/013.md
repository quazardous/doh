# Task: Refactor all epic-related commands to use helpers

## Description
Refactor all epic-related DOH commands to use the new helper pattern, reducing them to 1-3 line orchestration layers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `/doh:epic-new` refactored to use helper
- [ ] `/doh:epic-decompose` refactored to use helper
- [ ] `/doh:epic-sync` refactored to use helper
- [ ] `/doh:epic-show` refactored to use helper
- [ ] All commands maintain backwards compatibility
- [ ] Commands reduced to 1-3 lines each

## Technical Details
**IMPORTANT**: Read [docs/writing-good-scripts.md](docs/writing-good-scripts.md) for helper usage rules in commands vs scripts.
- Identify all epic-related commands in `.claude/commands/`
- Extract complex logic to epic helper functions
- Replace with: `helper.sh epic <action> "$@"`
- Ensure all parameters passed correctly
- Maintain exact command interfaces

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002: Epic domain helper must be complete

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-6
- Parallel: false (modifies command files)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All epic commands refactored
- [ ] Commands are 1-3 lines max
- [ ] Backwards compatibility verified
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Code reviewed
