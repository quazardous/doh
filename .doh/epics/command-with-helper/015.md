# Task: Refactor task and version commands to use helpers

## Description
Refactor all task-related and version-related DOH commands to use the new helper pattern, reducing them to 1-3 line orchestration layers.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `/doh:task-new` refactored to use helper
- [ ] `/doh:task-show` refactored to use helper
- [ ] `/doh:task-sync` refactored to use helper
- [ ] `/doh:version-bump` refactored to use helper
- [ ] `/doh:version-show` refactored to use helper
- [ ] All commands maintain backwards compatibility
- [ ] Commands reduced to 1-3 lines each

## Technical Details
**IMPORTANT**: Read [docs/writing-good-scripts.md](docs/writing-good-scripts.md) for helper usage rules in commands vs scripts.
- Identify all task and version-related commands in `.claude/commands/`
- Extract complex logic to task and version helper functions
- Replace with: `helper.sh task <action> "$@"` or `helper.sh version <action> "$@"`
- Ensure all parameters passed correctly
- Maintain exact command interfaces

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004: Task domain helper must be complete
- [ ] Task 005: Version domain helper must be complete

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 6-8
- Parallel: false (modifies command files)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All task and version commands refactored
- [ ] Commands are 1-3 lines max
- [ ] Backwards compatibility verified
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Code reviewed
