# Task: Implement task domain helper with decompose/status functions

## Description
Create the task domain helper that handles task decomposition from epics and task status management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Task helper created at `.claude/scripts/doh/helper/task/`
- [ ] Supports `helper.sh task decompose <epic_name>` for epic task creation
- [ ] Supports `helper.sh task status <task_number>` for task status checks
- [ ] Supports `helper.sh task update <task_number> <status>` for status updates
- [ ] Uses frontmatter API for all markdown operations
- [ ] Proper error handling and validation

## Technical Details
**IMPORTANT**: Read [docs/writing-good-scripts.md](docs/writing-good-scripts.md) for complete helper implementation patterns.
- Create `.claude/scripts/doh/helper/task/` directory
- Implement decompose.sh for epic to task breakdown
- Implement status.sh for task status management
- Implement update.sh for task status updates
- Use `./.claude/scripts/doh/api.sh frontmatter` for all frontmatter ops
- Use `./.claude/scripts/doh/api.sh task` for task operations
- Extract logic from existing task commands

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Helper infrastructure must be complete

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8
- Parallel: true (can run alongside other domain helpers)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Task helper scripts created
- [ ] Can successfully decompose epics into tasks
- [ ] Can manage task status effectively
- [ ] Uses frontmatter API exclusively
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
