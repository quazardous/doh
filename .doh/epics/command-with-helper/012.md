## Technical Details
**IMPORTANT**: Read [docs/writing-good-scripts.md](docs/writing-good-scripts.md) for complete helper architecture and performance guidelines.
- Benchmark helper invocation overhead
- Compare before/after command execution times
- Document helper conventions in docs/
- Create examples for common patterns
- Update CLAUDE.md with helper guidelines

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 011: Test coverage must be complete

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 3-4
- Parallel: false (final validation task)

## Definition of Done
