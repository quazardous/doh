# Task: Workspace Navigation Commands

## Description
Create helper commands that make it easy to navigate between workspaces, check current status, list all active worktrees, and switch monitoring focus without manual directory changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `/doh:where` shows current workspace clearly
- [ ] `/doh:goto` switches between main and worktrees
- [ ] `/doh:list-workspaces` displays all active workspaces
- [ ] Workspace switch warnings work properly
- [ ] Navigation preserves workspace state

## Technical Details
- **New commands to implement**:
  - `/doh:where` - Display current workspace with full details
  - `/doh:goto <target>` - Switch to main or specific worktree
  - `/doh:list-workspaces` - Show all worktrees and their status
  - `/doh:workspace-status` - Detailed status of current workspace
- **Implementation approach**:
  - Commands built on workspace library functions
  - Smart detection of target directories
  - Warning prompts for workspace switches
  - State preservation during navigation
- **Output formats**:
  ```
  Current Workspace:
    Mode: worktree
    Branch: epic/feature-x
    Directory: ../epic-feature-x/
    Parent: /home/user/project
    Active agents: 2
  ```

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (workspace library for detection)
- [ ] Task 004 (monitoring for status info)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 6 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside task 007)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All navigation commands implemented
- [ ] Workspace switches work smoothly
- [ ] Warnings display for workspace changes
- [ ] Status information accurate and helpful
- [ ] Commands integrated with workspace library
