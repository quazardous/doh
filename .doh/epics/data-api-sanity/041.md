# Task 041: Refactor Status Reporting Scripts

## Scripts to Refactor:
- `status.sh` - Overall project status → Create `project.sh` library
- `epic-status.sh` - Epic status reporting → Create `epic.sh` library
- `prd-status.sh` - PRD status reporting → ✅ Created `prd.sh` library

## Pattern for All Scripts:
Each script should become a thin wrapper (~10-15 lines) that:
1. Sources the corresponding library
2. Calls a single library function
3. Contains comment: "This entire script is equivalent to: api.sh <library> <function>"

## Libraries to Create:
- ✅ `prd.sh` - PRD management functions (DONE)
- `epic.sh` - Epic management functions with `epic_get_status()`, `epic_get_tasks()`, etc.
- `project.sh` - Project-wide status functions with `project_get_status()`, `project_get_summary()`, etc.

## Implementation:
1. Move ALL business logic to library functions
2. Scripts become thin wrappers calling library functions
3. All libraries follow no-op sourcing pattern
4. Functions use consistent `{lib_name}_` prefix
5. Scripts should be replaceable by: `api.sh <library> <function>`
