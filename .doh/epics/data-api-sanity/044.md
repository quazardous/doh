# Task 044: Refactor Epic Management Scripts

## Scripts to Refactor (ALL become thin wrappers):
- `epic-show.sh` → Wrapper calling `epic_show()` from epic.sh library
- `standup.sh` → Wrapper calling `reporting_generate_standup()` from reporting.sh library

## Libraries to Create/Update:
- Update `epic.sh` - Add `epic_show(epic_name)` function
- Create `reporting.sh` library with functions:
   - `reporting_generate_standup([date])` - Generate daily standup
   - `reporting_generate_epic_summary(epic_name)` - Detailed epic report
   - `reporting_format_progress(completed, total)` - Progress bar formatting
   - `reporting_get_recent_activity([days])` - Recent task activity

## Thin Wrapper Pattern:
Each script becomes equivalent to:
- `epic-show.sh` ≡ `api.sh epic show "$@"`
- `standup.sh` ≡ `api.sh reporting generate_standup "$@"`

All business logic moves to respective library functions.
