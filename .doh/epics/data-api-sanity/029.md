# Task 029: Comprehensive testing and integration validation

## Overview
Implement comprehensive testing framework for the refactored library architecture, validate all integrations work correctly, and ensure zero regressions from the API-first migration. This task provides confidence that the new architecture is solid and ready for production use.

## Requirements

### 1. Library Isolation Testing
Test each library independently to ensure no-op sourcing works correctly:

**Test Framework Structure:**
```
tests/unit/libraries/
├── test_doh_core.sh           # Test doh.sh isolation
├── test_dohenv.sh             # Test dohenv.sh isolation  
├── test_numbering.sh          # Test numbering.sh isolation
├── test_frontmatter.sh        # Test frontmatter.sh isolation
├── test_workspace.sh          # Test workspace.sh isolation
├── test_version.sh            # Test version.sh isolation
├── test_registers.sh          # Test registers.sh isolation
├── test_file_cache.sh         # Test file-cache.sh isolation
└── test_graph_cache.sh        # Test graph-cache.sh isolation
```

**Library Test Requirements:**
- [ ] Library sources without errors
- [ ] No automatic execution during sourcing
- [ ] Source guards prevent duplicate loading
- [ ] Dependencies properly resolved
- [ ] Public API functions available after sourcing
- [ ] Private functions properly prefixed with `_`

### 2. API Function Testing
Comprehensive testing of all API functions:

**Function Test Categories:**
- **Input Validation**: Test edge cases and invalid inputs
- **Error Handling**: Verify consistent error behavior
- **Functionality**: Confirm correct operation
- **Performance**: Ensure acceptable performance
- **Integration**: Test function interactions

**API Function Test Coverage:**
- `find_doh_root` and core functions in `doh.sh`
- `load_doh_env` and environment functions in `dohenv.sh`
- Version management functions in `version.sh`
- Frontmatter operations in `frontmatter.sh`
- File discovery functions in `file-cache.sh`
- Registry operations in `registers.sh`

### 3. Command Integration Testing
Validate that all migrated commands work correctly:

**Command Test Framework:**
```
tests/integration/commands/
├── test_epic_commands.sh      # Test epic-* commands
├── test_task_commands.sh      # Test task-* commands
├── test_version_commands.sh   # Test version-* commands
├── test_prd_commands.sh       # Test prd-* commands
└── test_utility_commands.sh   # Test utility commands
```

**Integration Test Requirements:**
- [ ] All commands execute without library loading errors
- [ ] Commands use API functions exclusively
- [ ] No direct file access patterns remain
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Command functionality preserved
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved

### 4. Dependency Chain Testing
Validate the library dependency chain works correctly:

**Dependency Test Scenarios:**
- Load each library and verify dependencies auto-load
- Test various loading combinations
- Verify source guards prevent duplicate loading
- Test loading order doesn't affect functionality
- Validate circular dependency prevention

**Dependency Matrix Validation:**
- `doh.sh`: No dependencies (core)
- `dohenv.sh`: Requires `doh.sh`
- `numbering.sh`: Requires `doh.sh`, `dohenv.sh`
- `workspace.sh`: Requires `doh.sh`, `dohenv.sh`
- `version.sh`: Requires `doh.sh`, `dohenv.sh`, `frontmatter.sh`
- And all other libraries per matrix

### 5. Regression Testing
Ensure all existing functionality still works:

**Regression Test Coverage:**
- Run complete existing test suite
- Test all DOH workflows end-to-end
- Validate performance hasn't degraded
- Confirm error handling improved or maintained
- Test edge cases and unusual scenarios

**Specific Regression Areas:**
- Epic and task management workflows
- Version management operations
- PRD creation and parsing
- File caching and discovery
- Registry operations
- Git operations integration

### 6. Existing Test Suite Integration
Run all existing DOH tests to ensure no regressions:

**Existing Test Framework Integration:**
- Execute complete existing test suite with new libraries
- Validate all current functionality still works
- Test with new function names and API patterns
- Ensure test framework can load new library structure
- Update test helpers to use new API functions

**Test Commands:**
```bash
# Run full existing test suite
./tests/run.sh

# Run specific test categories with new libraries
./tests/test_launcher.sh tests/unit/test_version.sh
./tests/test_launcher.sh tests/integration/test_epic_workflow.sh
```

### 7. Performance Testing
Validate that library changes don't negatively impact performance:

**Performance Metrics:**
- Library loading time (should be <50ms per library)
- API function execution time
- Command execution time comparison
- Memory usage during operations
- File system operation efficiency

### 8. Error Handling Validation
Test that error handling is consistent and improved:

**Error Handling Test Areas:**
- Missing dependencies
- Invalid function parameters
- File system errors
- Permission issues
- Malformed data handling
- Network/external service errors
