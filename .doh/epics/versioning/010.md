# Task: Version validation utilities

## Description
Create comprehensive version validation utilities for DOH to ensure semantic versioning compliance, format validation, and version comparison capabilities. These utilities will be used across all version-related operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Semantic version validation following semver.org specification
- [ ] Version format checking with detailed error messages
- [ ] Version comparison utilities (greater than, less than, equal)
- [ ] Pre-release and build metadata handling
- [ ] Integration with DOH error handling patterns
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for edge cases

## Technical Details
### Validation Functions
1. **Semver Validation**
   - Validate against semver.org specification
   - Check major.minor.patch format
   - Handle pre-release identifiers (alpha, beta, rc)
   - Support build metadata (+build.1)
   - Provide detailed error messages for invalid formats

2. **Format Checking**
   - Numeric validation for version components
   - Leading zero detection and handling
   - Special character validation
   - Length and boundary checks

3. **Version Comparison**
   - Compare two semantic versions
   - Handle pre-release version precedence
   - Support sorting operations
   - Range matching capabilities

### Implementation Approach
- Extend version.sh library with validation functions
- Use bash functions for maximum compatibility
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Support both strict and lenient validation modes
- Include extensive test cases

## Dependencies
- [ ] Version library (version.sh) foundation
- [ ] Bash regex and pattern matching

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 4-6
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All validation functions implemented and tested
- [ ] Semver.org compliance verified
- [ ] Version comparison utilities working correctly
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Unit tests cover all edge cases
- [ ] Integration with DOH patterns complete
- [ ] Documentation includes usage examples
