# Task: Version system testing suite

## Description
Develop comprehensive testing suite for the DOH versioning system, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end workflows. Ensure all version features are thoroughly tested and reliable.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for all version library functions
- [ ] Integration tests for version commands
- [ ] End-to-end workflow tests
- [ ] Edge case and error condition testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Test coverage reporting
- [ ] Automated test execution in CI

## Technical Details
### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Version validation functions
   - Version comparison logic
   - Semver parsing
   - File header injection
   - Version bump calculations
   - Milestone condition checking

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Command execution flows
   - File system operations
   - Registry updates
   - Graph cache integration
   - Cross-command workflows

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Complete version lifecycle
   - Multi-version planning
   - Release workflows
   - Migration scenarios
   - Rollback procedures

### Test Implementation
1. **Test Framework**
   - Use bash test framework (bats or similar)
   - Organize tests by component
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Isolated test environments

2. **Test Data**
   - Valid version samples
   - Invalid version edge cases
   - Complex version histories
   - Migration test projects
   - Performance test datasets

3. **Coverage Areas**
   - Happy path scenarios
   - Error conditions
   - Boundary values
   - Concurrent operations
   - Data integrity

### Test Automation
- Pre-commit hooks for quick tests
- CI pipeline integration
- Nightly regression tests
- Performance monitoring
- Coverage reporting

## Dependencies
- [ ] Version library implementation
- [ ] Version commands complete
- [ ] Validation utilities ready

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 10-12
- Parallel: false (depends on implementation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All test categories implemented
- [ ] 80%+ code coverage achieved
- [ ] Tests run automatically in CI
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Test documentation complete
- [ ] Failure scenarios covered
- [ ] Test data managed properly
- [ ] Results reporting automated
