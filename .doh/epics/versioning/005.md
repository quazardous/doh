# Task: Create frontmatter integration

## Description
Implement parsing and manipulation of YAML frontmatter in markdown files for the versioning system. This includes reading, updating, and writing frontmatter data while preserving file integrity.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Parse YAML frontmatter from markdown files ✅
- [x] Update frontmatter fields programmatically ✅
- [x] Write modified frontmatter back to files ✅
- [x] Handle missing or malformed frontmatter gracefully ✅
- [x] Preserve file content and formatting ✅

## Technical Details
- Create frontmatter parsing utilities
- Implement safe YAML parsing with error handling
- Add functions for common frontmatter operations (get, set, update)
- Ensure compatibility with existing DOH markdown files
- Use appropriate library for YAML processing (yq, js-yaml, etc.)

## Definition of Done
- [x] Frontmatter utilities implemented ✅ (.claude/scripts/doh/lib/frontmatter.sh)
- [x] Unit tests for all functions ✅ (tests/unit/test_frontmatter_simple.sh)
- [x] Documentation for API usage ✅ (comprehensive function documentation)
- [x] Integration with versioning workflow ✅ (version.sh integrates with frontmatter.sh)
- [x] No data loss during file operations ✅ (atomic operations with temp files)

## Completion Notes

**Implementation Summary**: The frontmatter integration was already well-implemented in the existing codebase with a comprehensive library (`frontmatter.sh`) that provides:
- YAML frontmatter extraction between `---` delimiters
- Field-specific value retrieval with quote handling
- Atomic field updates with content preservation
- Validation of required fields
- Error handling for missing files

**Key Fixes Applied**:
- Fixed `extract_frontmatter()` function to correctly parse between delimiters
- Fixed `update_frontmatter_field()` to properly preserve file content after frontmatter
- Enhanced error handling and edge case management

**Testing Coverage**: Created comprehensive test suite with 19 test cases covering:
- Basic frontmatter extraction and field retrieval
- Field updates and additions
- Error handling for missing files
- Integration with version management system
- Content preservation and formatting

**Integration Status**: Frontmatter library is fully integrated with the version management system, enabling seamless version field manipulation in DOH markdown files (PRDs, epics, tasks).
