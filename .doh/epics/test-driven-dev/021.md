# Task 021: Amend doh-tdd.md for test-inspired development approach

## Description

Update the `./docs/doh-tdd.md` documentation to reflect a lighter, more pragmatic "test-inspired development" approach rather than strict TDD. This acknowledges that for exploratory coding and bash scripting, writing tests after initial implementation is often more practical while still maintaining test coverage goals.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Update introduction to clarify "test-inspired" vs strict TDD approach
- [ ] Add section on when to write tests (during or after implementation)
- [ ] Include guidance on exploratory coding followed by test creation
- [ ] Maintain emphasis on test coverage but remove strict "test-first" requirements
- [ ] Add practical examples of test-inspired workflow for DOH development
- [ ] Keep existing technical content but adjust philosophical approach

## Technical Details

**File to modify:**
- `./docs/doh-tdd.md` - Update to reflect test-inspired development

**Key changes:**
- Reframe from "Test-Driven" to "Test-Inspired" development
- Acknowledge that tests can be written during or after implementation
- Focus on pragmatic testing for bash scripts and CLI tools
- Emphasize test coverage and quality over strict timing
- Add section on retroactive test creation for existing code

**Approach:**
- Keep all technical guidance about test structure and patterns
- Modify philosophical sections about when tests are written
- Add examples of practical test-inspired workflows
- Acknowledge that exploratory coding is valid

## Dependencies

- Depends on Task 015 (documentation must exist first)
- Does not block other tasks (philosophical update only)

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** XS (Extra Small - documentation update only)
- **Hours:** 1 hour
- **Parallel:** false (modifies same file as 015)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect test-inspired approach
- [ ] Examples show both test-first and test-after workflows
- [ ] Guidance remains practical and actionable
- [ ] Technical content preserved with philosophical shift
- [ ] File remains consistent and well-organized
