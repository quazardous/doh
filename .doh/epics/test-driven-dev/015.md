# Task 015: Create TDD rules documentation

## Description

Create comprehensive TDD documentation for the DOH project, establishing both universal TDD patterns and DOH-specific testing guidance. This foundational documentation will serve as the reference for all subsequent TDD implementations in the project.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `./rules/tdd.md` with universal TDD patterns including:
  - Red-Green-Refactor cycle
  - Test structure best practices
  - Naming conventions
  - Common patterns and anti-patterns
- [ ] Create `./docs/doh-tdd.md` with DOH-specific guidance including:
  - Testing patterns for bash scripts
  - Integration with DOH workflow
  - Testing epic and task management functions
  - Mock and fixture strategies
- [ ] Documentation is clear, actionable, and follows DOH documentation standards
- [ ] Both files are properly integrated into the project structure

## Technical Details

**Files to create:**
- `./rules/tdd.md`: Universal TDD patterns and principles
- `./docs/doh-tdd.md`: DOH-specific TDD implementation guidance

**Content requirements:**
- Universal patterns: Test structure, naming, lifecycle, best practices
- DOH-specific: Bash testing patterns, workspace testing, file system mocking
- Integration points with existing DOH workflows
- Clear examples and practical guidance

**Size estimate:** S (Small - foundational documentation)

**Dependencies:** This is the foundation task - other TDD tasks depend on it
