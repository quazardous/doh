# Task 017: Create test runner and directory structure

## Description

Create the complete test infrastructure including the main test runner script and organized directory structure. This establishes the operational foundation for running tests consistently across the DOH project.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `./tests/run.sh` main test runner script
- [ ] Establish directory structure:
  - `./tests/unit/` for unit tests
  - `./tests/integration/` for integration tests  
  - `./tests/fixtures/` for test data and fixtures
  - `./tests/helpers/` for test utilities and shared code
- [ ] Runner supports:
  - Running all tests or specific test suites
  - Parallel execution options
  - Verbose and quiet output modes
  - CI/CD integration with proper exit codes
- [ ] Integration with the minimal test framework from Task 016
- [ ] Documentation for test organization and execution
- [ ] Example tests demonstrating the structure

## Technical Details

**Directory structure:**
```
tests/
├── run.sh              # Main test runner
├── unit/               # Unit tests
├── integration/        # Integration tests
├── fixtures/           # Test data
└── helpers/            # Test utilities
```

**Runner capabilities:**
- Test discovery across unit/ and integration/ directories
- Support for test filtering (by pattern, suite, etc.)
- Integration with Task 016's test framework
- Proper error handling and reporting
- CI/CD friendly exit codes and output

**Size estimate:** S (Small - infrastructure setup)

**Dependencies:** Requires Task 016 (test framework) for execution engine
