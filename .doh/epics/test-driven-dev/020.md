# Task 020: Write example tests demonstrating patterns

## Description

Create comprehensive example tests that demonstrate all available assertion types and testing patterns within the DOH TDD framework. Include self-testing capabilities for the test framework itself to ensure its reliability and serve as validation of the testing infrastructure.

These examples will serve as both documentation and validation, showing developers exactly how to use the testing framework effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Example tests created for all assertion types:
  - Basic assertions (assertEquals, assertTrue, assertFalse)
  - File system assertions (assertFileExists, assertDirectoryExists)
  - String/pattern assertions (assertContains, assertMatches)
  - Command execution assertions (assertCommandSucceeds, assertCommandFails)
  - Custom DOH-specific assertions
- [ ] Self-testing tests that validate the framework itself:
  - Test runner functionality
  - Assertion behavior verification
  - Error handling validation
  - Output formatting checks
- [ ] Pattern demonstration tests:
  - Setup/teardown patterns
  - Test isolation techniques
  - Mock/stub usage examples
  - Integration test patterns
- [ ] All example tests pass when run
- [ ] Examples are well-documented with comments
- [ ] Code demonstrates best practices

## Technical Details

### Example Test Categories
1. **Basic Framework Tests**: Validate core testing functionality
2. **Assertion Pattern Tests**: Demonstrate each assertion type with examples
3. **Integration Pattern Tests**: Show how to test complex workflows
4. **Self-Validation Tests**: Framework testing itself

### Test File Structure
```
./tests/examples/
├── basic_assertions_test.sh      # Basic assertion examples
├── file_operations_test.sh       # File system testing patterns
├── command_execution_test.sh     # Command testing examples
├── integration_patterns_test.sh  # Complex workflow testing
└── framework_validation_test.sh  # Self-testing of the framework
```

### Self-Testing Requirements
- Test framework can run its own validation
- Assertion functions work as expected
- Error handling behaves correctly
- Output formatting is consistent
- Test discovery finds all tests

### Documentation Standards
- Each test file includes header comments explaining purpose
- Individual tests have descriptive comments
- Examples show both positive and negative test cases
- Best practices are demonstrated and explained
