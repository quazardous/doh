# Task 018: Migrate existing tests from runtime area

## Description

Move all existing tests from the runtime area `.claude/scripts/doh/tests` to the standardized `./tests` directory structure. Update any references to the old test location throughout the codebase to ensure compatibility with the new TDD framework.

This migration establishes the proper test location and ensures existing tests work within the new testing infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All test files moved from `.claude/scripts/doh/tests` to `./tests`
- [ ] Directory structure preserved during migration
- [ ] All references to old test paths updated in:
  - Documentation files
  - Script imports or source commands
  - Configuration files
  - Other test files
- [ ] Existing tests continue to pass after migration
- [ ] No broken references or import paths remain
- [ ] Test discovery works with new location

## Technical Details

### Migration Steps
1. **Inventory existing tests**: Catalog all files in `.claude/scripts/doh/tests`
2. **Create target structure**: Ensure `./tests` directory with proper subdirectories
3. **Move test files**: Preserve relative paths and file permissions
4. **Update references**: Search for and update all path references
5. **Verify functionality**: Run tests to ensure they work in new location

### Files to Update
- Any scripts that source or include test files
- Documentation referencing test locations
- CI/CD configurations (if any)
- Test runner scripts or configurations

### Verification
- All migrated tests pass when run from new location
- No broken imports or missing file errors
- Test discovery mechanisms find all tests

**Size Estimate**: S
