# Task 005: Integrate QUICK system auto-creation into /doh:init with reserved name protection

## Overview

Modify the `/doh:init` command to automatically create the reserved QUICK system directory structure. This ensures every DOH project has the quick task container available and prevents users from creating epics with the reserved name.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### QUICK System Auto-Creation
- Create `.doh/quick/` directory during `/doh:init`
- Generate proper `epic.md` file with never-completing status
- Set up minimal PRD reference (can point to general quick-epic.md)
- Include clear documentation about QUICK system purpose

#### Reserved Name Protection
- Validate epic names during creation to prevent "QUICK" usage
- Display clear error message if user tries to create QUICK system
- Provide guidance on using `/doh:quick` command instead
- Update validation in relevant epic creation commands

#### Integration Points
- Modify existing `/doh:init` workflow seamlessly
- Ensure QUICK system appears in status reports
- Make QUICK tasks discoverable by `/doh:next`
- Maintain compatibility with existing DOH commands

### Technical Requirements

#### File Structure
```
.doh/quick/
├── epic.md                # Never-completing epic
└── .gitkeep              # Ensure directory tracked
```

#### Epic Configuration
- **Status**: Always "active" (never completed)
- **Type**: Hardcoded as "quick-tasks"  
- **PRD Reference**: Links to quick-epic.md or standalone
- **Special Flag**: `reserved: true` to prevent user modification

#### Validation Logic
- Check epic name against reserved list during creation
- Block PRD creation with name "QUICK"
- Provide helpful error messages with alternatives

## Implementation Details

### /doh:init Integration
```bash
# Add to existing init workflow
create_quick_epic() {
    mkdir -p .doh/quick
    generate_quick_epic_file
    echo "✅ QUICK system created for ad-hoc tasks"
}
```

### QUICK Epic Template
```yaml
---
name: QUICK
status: active
type: quick-tasks
reserved: true
created: 2025-08-31T15:02:00Z
description: "Reserved epic for quick tasks and hotfixes"
never_complete: true
---

# Epic: QUICK (Reserved)

## Overview
This is a reserved system for quick tasks, hotfixes, and ad-hoc work that doesn't fit existing epics.

## Usage
- Use `/doh:quick "description"` to add tasks to this system
- This system never completes and serves as a permanent container
- Tasks here should be small, focused improvements or fixes

## Scope
- Bug fixes
- Small improvements  
- Hotfixes
- Refactoring tasks
- Quick optimizations

**Do not add large features or new requirements here.**
```

### Name Validation
- Update epic creation commands to check reserved names
- Add validation to PRD creation as well
- Provide clear guidance on alternatives

### Dependencies
- Existing `/doh:init` command structure
- DOH validation patterns
- Integration with status and next commands

## Testing Strategy

### Initialization Testing
1. **Fresh Init**: Verify QUICK system created in new projects
2. **Existing Projects**: Test behavior when QUICK already exists
3. **Permissions**: Ensure directory creation works in various environments
4. **Git Integration**: Verify .gitkeep ensures tracking

### Validation Testing
1. **Reserved Name Block**: Try creating "QUICK" system manually
2. **Case Sensitivity**: Test "quick", "Quick", "QUICK" variations
3. **Error Messages**: Validate helpful guidance provided
4. **Alternative Suggestions**: Ensure users know about `/doh:quick`

### Integration Testing
- QUICK tasks appear in `/doh:next` output
- Status reports include QUICK system information
- GitHub sync handles reserved system correctly

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/doh:init` automatically creates QUICK system directory
- [ ] QUICK epic.md uses never-completing template
- [ ] Reserved name validation prevents user-created QUICK systems
- [ ] Error messages provide clear guidance and alternatives
- [ ] Integration with existing DOH commands seamless
- [ ] QUICK tasks discoverable by status and next commands
- [ ] Documentation clearly explains QUICK system purpose and usage

## Definition of Done

- `/doh:init` command updated with QUICK system creation
- Reserved name validation implemented across epic creation
- Template files created and tested
- Integration with existing DOH workflow verified
- Error handling provides helpful user guidance
- All test scenarios pass
