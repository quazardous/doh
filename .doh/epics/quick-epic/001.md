# Task 001: Create AI-powered matching system with semantic analysis

## Overview

Create an AI-powered matching system that uses Claude to analyze task descriptions against PRD content for intelligent semantic matching. This leverages natural language understanding rather than keyword-based approaches.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### AI-Powered Matching
- Use Claude/AI to analyze task description against PRD content
- Leverage natural language understanding for semantic matching
- Handle technical terminology and domain concepts intelligently
- Support context-aware similarity detection beyond keyword matching

#### Scoring Algorithm
- **Semantic Similarity**: 70% weight - AI assessment of conceptual overlap
- **Domain Relevance**: 20% weight - technical domain relationship analysis  
- **Recency**: 10% weight - favor more recently updated PRDs
- Configurable threshold (default: 30% minimum match)

#### PRD Analysis
- Read all PRD files from `.doh/prds/` directory
- Parse frontmatter and full description content
- Use AI prompting to compare task description with each PRD
- Generate relevance scores and reasoning

### Technical Requirements

#### AI Integration
- **Input**: Task description string
- **Output**: Sorted array of PRD matches with scores and reasoning
- **Format**: `[{"prd": "feature-name", "score": 85, "reasoning": "Both involve user authentication flows"}]`

#### Performance
- AI analysis completes in < 5 seconds for batch processing
- Support parallel analysis for improved performance
- Graceful degradation if AI service unavailable

#### Error Handling  
- Handle missing or corrupted PRD files gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages for AI service issues
- Fall back to simple string matching if AI analysis fails

## Implementation Details

### AI-Powered Approach
1. **PRD Collection**: Gather all PRD files and content
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Create effective comparison prompts for Claude
3. **Batch Analysis**: Send task description + PRD content for semantic analysis
4. **Score Extraction**: Parse AI responses for relevance scores and reasoning
5. **Ranking**: Sort results by score, filter below threshold
6. **Output**: Return formatted results with explanations

### Command Integration
```bash
# /doh:quick will use Claude Code's AI capabilities
# Integration with existing command structure
.claude/commands/doh/quick.md     # Command definition
.claude/scripts/doh/quick.sh      # Shell wrapper that calls AI analysis
```

### AI Prompt Strategy
- Provide clear context about DOH project structure
- Include task description and PRD content in prompts
- Request structured output with scores and reasoning
- Handle edge cases (empty PRDs, unclear descriptions)

### Dependencies
- Claude Code AI integration capabilities
- Existing `.claude/scripts/doh/lib/frontmatter.sh` library
- DOH command structure and patterns
- AI service availability and error handling

## Testing Strategy

### Test Cases
1. **High Semantic Similarity**: Task conceptually aligns with PRD (80%+ score)
2. **Medium Relevance**: Task partially relates to PRD scope (30-60% score)  
3. **Low Relevance**: Task has minimal connection to PRD (<30% score)
4. **No Match**: Task doesn't relate to any existing PRD
5. **Edge Cases**: Empty descriptions, highly technical jargon, ambiguous requests

### AI Response Testing
- Validate AI provides consistent scoring across similar inputs
- Test reasoning quality and helpfulness to users
- Ensure graceful handling of AI service interruptions
- Verify fallback mechanisms work correctly

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AI analysis provides semantic understanding beyond keyword matching
- [ ] Scoring reflects conceptual similarity (validated with 10 diverse test cases)
- [ ] Performance meets < 5 second requirement for AI processing
- [ ] Results include clear reasoning for user understanding
- [ ] Configurable threshold filtering works correctly
- [ ] Error handling covers AI service issues gracefully
- [ ] Integration with Claude Code AI capabilities successful

## Definition of Done

- AI-powered matching system implemented and integrated
- Performance benchmarks met with AI processing
- Command integration with DOH structure complete
- User experience enhanced with AI reasoning explanations
- All test cases passing including AI service disruption scenarios
