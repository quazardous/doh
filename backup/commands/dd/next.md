# /dd:next - AI-Powered TODO Analysis & Task Recommendation Engine

Intelligent task prioritization system that analyzes TODO dependencies, developer context, and project priorities to
suggest the optimal next tasks with natural language interaction support.

## Usage

```bash
/dd:next [query] [--context=focus] [--project=type] [--internal] [--format=output] [--limit=N] [--refresh] [--cache-only] [--no-cache]
```

## Parameters

### Primary Input
- `query`: (Optional) Natural language query about what to work on
  - **Examples**: `"what can I do that's high impact"`, `"show me documentation tasks"`, `"what's ready to start"`
  - **Smart matching**: Understands intent and maps to appropriate filters
  - **If omitted**: Shows top priority tasks based on current project state

### Context Filtering  
- `--context=focus`: Filter recommendations by development area
  - `docs` - Documentation and writing tasks (README, WORKFLOW, TODO updates)
  - `build` - Build system and architecture tasks
  - `testing` - Testing, QA, and quality assurance tasks  
  - `features` - Core functionality development and implementation
  - `quick` - Tasks that can be completed in under 2 hours
  - `blocked` - Show what's currently blocking other tasks (dependencies)
  - **Smart detection**: Analyzes task tags and descriptions for automatic categorization

### Project Filtering
- `--project=type`: Filter tasks by project context for isolation
  - `doh-dev` - Internal development support and tooling (dd-x.x.x versioning)
  - `doh-runtime` - Public distribution and end-user features (doh-x.x.x versioning)
  - `all` - Show both projects with clear separation (default behavior)
  - **Dependency isolation**: Respects project boundaries, warns on cross-project dependencies

- `--internal`: Convenient shorthand for `--project=doh-dev`
  - **Focus**: DOH-DEV internal development tasks (dd-x.x.x versioning)
  - **Default behavior**: Without this flag, focuses on DOH runtime user features (doh-x.x.x)
  - **Equivalent to**: `--project=doh-dev` for streamlined workflow
  - **Task indicators**: Version files `dd-*.md`, internal tooling, command enhancements

### Output Control
- `--format=output`: Control the level of detail in responses
  - `brief` - Concise task list with key information (default)
  - `detailed` - Full analysis with reasoning, dependencies, and impact
  - `plan` - Step-by-step implementation plan for recommended tasks
  - **Adaptive**: Format adjusts based on query complexity

- `--limit=N`: Maximum number of tasks to suggest
  - **Default**: 3-5 tasks (optimal for decision making)
  - **Range**: 1-20 (automatically caps at available tasks)
  - **Smart limiting**: Prioritizes most relevant tasks

### Performance Modes  
- `--cache-only`: Ultra-fast mode using smart memory
  - **Speed**: Sub-100ms response time
  - **Source**: Reads directly from todo/NEXT.md memory file
  - **Use when**: Quick checks, rapid workflow, scripting integration
  - **Note**: Results may be slightly outdated if tasks recently changed

- `--refresh`: Force complete re-analysis
  - **Ignores**: Existing todo/NEXT.md cache
  - **Rebuilds**: Complete task analysis from current todo/ folder state
  - **Use when**: Major task changes, memory corruption, or fresh perspective needed
  - **Slower**: Takes 3-5 seconds but guarantees current accuracy

- `--no-cache`: Pure analysis without memory
  - **Clean slate**: Ignores memory file entirely
  - **No updates**: Doesn't update todo/NEXT.md with results
  - **Use when**: Testing, debugging, or when memory file is problematic

## Smart Memory System

The command uses `todo/NEXT.md` as intelligent memory with version awareness and pre-computed queries.

### Version Goal Awareness

The command reads `todo/doh-*.md` and `todo/dd-*.md` version files to understand:
- Current version philosophy and goals (Must Have/Should Have/Should NOT Have)
- Version constraints that affect task selection  
- Key strategic decisions that guide recommendations
- Progress context (~XX% completion estimates)

Version awareness ensures task recommendations align with strategic goals and respects version constraints like "Should NOT Have: External API dependencies" for v1.4.0.

### Memory Architecture

- **todo/NEXT.md**: Claude's memory file with pre-analyzed task data and smart query results
- **Version awareness**: Tracks current version (1.4.0-dev) and version-specific tasks
- **Project classification**: Pre-computed DOH-DEV vs DOH Runtime task categorization
- **Pre-computed queries**: Common searches like "version 1.4", "quick wins", "high impact", "internal tasks" pre-calculated
- **Smart context matching**: Natural language queries instantly mapped to stored results including `--internal` context
- **Auto-update**: Memory refreshed on every standard call to maintain current state
- **Extreme speed**: `--cache-only` reads memory directly with zero re-computation overhead

## AI Analysis Engine

The command performs comprehensive intelligent analysis with memory optimization:

### 1. Dependency Mapping

- **Parses todo/ files** for individual task files and status (excludes todo/archive/ only)
- **Includes COMPLETED tasks**: Maintains dependency context from finished work in active epics
- **Identifies blockers**: Tasks marked as dependencies for others
- **Maps ready tasks**: Tasks with all dependencies completed
- **Calculates impact**: How many other tasks depend on this one
- **Stores results**: Saves analysis in todo/NEXT.md for Claude's memory
- **Archive Exclusion**: Ignores todo/archive/ directory for performance, keeps completed tasks in todo/ root

### 2. Context-Aware Filtering

- **Tag analysis**: Processes #doc, #build, #testing, #features tags
- **Project classification**: Identifies DOH-DEV Internal vs DOH Runtime tasks
  - **DOH-DEV Internal**: Version files `dd-*.md`, command enhancements, internal tooling
  - **DOH Runtime**: Version files `doh-*.md`, user-facing features, public distribution
- **Status tracking**: Differentiates IN PROGRESS, COMPLETED, and pending tasks
- **Priority parsing**: Extracts High/Medium/Low priority indicators
- **Complexity estimation**: Analyzes task descriptions for effort indicators
- **Cross-project dependency detection**: Warns when tasks cross project boundaries
- **Internal flag processing**: Automatically filters for DOH-DEV tasks when `--internal` used

### 3. Natural Language Processing

- **Intent recognition**: Understands queries like "what should I work on next?"
- **Context matching**: Maps natural language to technical categories
- **Smart filtering**: Interprets phrases like "high impact", "quick wins", "documentation work"
- **Project classification**: Recognizes "internal development", "runtime features", "command enhancements"
- **Auto-flag mapping**: Automatically applies `--internal` for DOH-DEV context queries
- **Conversational responses**: Provides explanations in natural language

### 4. Intelligent Prioritization Algorithm

**Priority Score Calculation**:

```
Priority Score = Base Priority √ó Dependency Weight √ó Context Relevance √ó Impact Factor
```

**Factors**:

- **Base Priority**: Explicit High (3.0), Medium (2.0), Low (1.0) or inferred from üö© flags
- **Dependency Weight**: 2.0 if no blockers, 0.5 if dependencies remain, 0.1 if blocked
- **Context Relevance**: 2.0 if matches user context/query, 1.0 baseline, 0.5 if mismatched
- **Impact Factor**: 1.5 if blocks other tasks, 1.0 baseline, 2.0 if critical path item

- **Quality Phase**: Emphasizes T024, T027, T019 (testing/linting)
- **Feature Phase**: Focuses on T020, T021, T017 (core functionality)
- **Polish Phase**: Suggests T037, T008, documentation tasks

### Workload Balancing

- **Heavy Development**: Suggests alternating with documentation tasks
- **Documentation Focus**: Recommends technical implementation tasks for balance
- **Testing Phase**: Identifies gaps in test coverage and quality systems

### Skill Context Adaptation

Adapts suggestions based on inferred developer preferences:

- **Documentation-heavy recent commits**: Suggests more technical tasks
- **Feature implementation patterns**: Recommends complementary testing/docs
- **System architecture focus**: Prioritizes foundational tasks

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Invalid TODO.md Structure

- **Graceful degradation**: Falls back to basic task listing if dependency parsing fails
- **Self-healing**: Reports TODO.md issues and suggests fixes
- **Partial analysis**: Provides best-effort recommendations even with incomplete data

### Circular Dependencies

- **Detection**: Identifies and reports circular dependency chains
- **Resolution**: Suggests dependency restructuring or task splitting
- **Bypass**: Recommends tasks outside the circular chain

### Context Mismatches

- **Clarification**: Asks follow-up questions for ambiguous queries
- **Alternative suggestions**: Offers closest matches when exact query impossible
- **Learning**: Adapts to user's working patterns over time

## Integration Points

## Implementation Architecture

This command is executed entirely by Claude's AI logic with smart memory:

### Execution Modes

#### Standard Mode (Default)

1. **Read Previous Memory**: Load existing todo/NEXT.md if available for context
2. **Analyze Current State**: Scan todo/ folder for any changes since last run
3. **Incremental Update**: Update analysis based on changes detected
4. **Generate Recommendations**: Create prioritized task suggestions
5. **Update Memory**: Refresh todo/NEXT.md with current analysis and recommendations
6. **Return Results**: Provide recommendations to user with fresh insights

#### Memory-Only Mode (`--cache-only`)

1. **Direct Read**: Load todo/NEXT.md memory file immediately
2. **Extract Recommendations**: Parse top recommendations from stored memory
3. **Format Output**: Apply requested format (brief/detailed/plan)
4. **Instant Return**: Provide memory-based recommendations with zero re-computation
5. **Skip Analysis**: No file scanning, no memory refresh, no analysis overhead

#### No-Cache Mode (`--no-cache`)

1. **Skip Memory**: Completely ignore todo/NEXT.md file (don't read or update)
2. **Fresh Analysis**: Scan todo/ folder and analyze all tasks from scratch
3. **Pure Computation**: Generate recommendations using only current file state
4. **No Memory Updates**: Don't update todo/NEXT.md with results
5. **Clean State**: Useful for testing, debugging, or when memory is corrupted

### Full Analysis (Memory Miss)

- **todo/ folder parsing**: Claude analyzes individual T*.md and E*.md files
- **Dependency resolution**: Claude builds dependency graphs and identifies ready tasks
- **Natural language processing**: Claude interprets user queries and provides conversational responses
- **Priority calculation**: Claude applies weighting algorithms and contextual scoring
- **Memory generation**: Claude creates todo/NEXT.md with comprehensive analysis for future reference
- **Response generation**: Claude formats recommendations in requested style

### Memory Benefits

- **Contextual continuity**: Maintains task analysis history and patterns
- **Faster computation**: Previous analysis provides baseline for incremental updates
- **Progress tracking**: Historical view of task completion and emerging priorities
- **Manual override**: `--refresh` flag forces complete re-analysis if needed
- **Extreme speed**: `--cache-only` provides sub-100ms responses using stored memory

### Performance Characteristics

| Mode | Response Time | Accuracy | Use Case |
|------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Standard | 1-3 seconds | Current | Normal workflow, up-to-date recommendations |
| Memory-Only | <100ms | Last update | Quick checks, rapid workflow, scripting |
| Refresh | 3-5 seconds | Perfect | Major changes, memory reset, fresh start |
| No-Cache | 2-4 seconds | Perfect | Testing, debugging, corrupted memory, clean analysis |

### Archive Management & Analysis Scope

**Analysis Scope Policy**:
- **Analyzes**: All files in `todo/` root directory (includes COMPLETED tasks)
- **Excludes**: `todo/archive/` directory entirely for performance
- **Rationale**: COMPLETED tasks provide context for recommendations and dependencies

**Smart Archive Management**:
- **Keep in todo/**: COMPLETED tasks from active epics (remain accessible for analysis)
- **Archive to todo/archive/**: Only tasks from fully COMPLETED epics  
- **Never Archive**: Tasks belonging to active/in-progress epics
- **Epic Status Check**: Before archiving, verify parent epic is COMPLETED

**Archive Rules**:
```bash
# Keep in todo/ (analyzed by /dd:next)
T064.md (COMPLETED) - Epic E001 still active ‚Üí Stay in todo/
T070.md (COMPLETED) - Epic E001 still active ‚Üí Stay in todo/

# Archive to todo/archive/ (excluded from analysis)
T027.md (COMPLETED) - Epic E003 COMPLETED ‚Üí Move to archive/
T018.md (COMPLETED) - Epic E002 COMPLETED ‚Üí Move to archive/
```

**Benefits**:
- **Context Preservation**: Completed tasks from active epics remain visible for dependency analysis
- **Performance**: Archive exclusion reduces scan time without losing relevant context
- **Epic Continuity**: All tasks related to active epics stay accessible

## AI-Driven Features

- **Learning**: Remembers user preferences and working patterns within conversation
- **Adaptation**: Adjusts recommendations based on project evolution and completed work
- **Explanation**: Provides clear reasoning for all suggestions to build user confidence
- **Flexibility**: Handles edge cases and ambiguous input gracefully with clarifying questions

## AI-Driven Optimization Detection

This command continuously learns and improves through pattern analysis:

### Auto-Detection Capabilities

**Query Pattern Analysis**:

- **Repetitive misses**: When user queries consistently miss relevant tasks
- **Context gaps**: When natural language queries don't match available filters
- **Preference learning**: When user repeatedly selects different options than recommended

**Example Detection Scenarios**:

```bash
# After 3 queries for "documentation work" miss T037, T008
üîç Optimization Detected: Documentation task detection incomplete
   Pattern: Queries for "doc work" missing tasks without #doc tag
   Missing: T037 (references cleanup), T008 (CLAUDE.md integration)

   Proposed: Enhanced semantic analysis beyond explicit tags
   - Scan descriptions for: "documentation", "README", "markdown", "cleanup"
   - Add inference: reference cleanup = documentation work

   Update /dd:next with this optimization? [Y/n]
```

**Dependency Resolution Learning**:

- **Blocked task patterns**: When dependency analysis misses implicit blockers
- **Priority miscalculation**: When impact scores don't match actual user selections
- **Context preference**: When user consistently picks tasks from specific categories

**Unlimited Discovery Scope**:

- **Emergent patterns**: Any new inefficiency, miss, or improvement opportunity I observe
- **Novel optimizations**: Creative solutions to problems I identify during execution
- **Cross-command learning**: Insights from other `/doh-dev` commands that could enhance task recommendations
- **User behavior adaptation**: Previously unknown preference patterns or work style insights

### Optimization Confirmation Workflow

1. **Pattern Recognition**: AI detects improvement opportunities during execution
2. **Impact Analysis**: Evaluates what would be enhanced
3. **User Confirmation**: Clear explanation + permission request
4. **Logic Enhancement**: Updates command intelligence
5. **Optimization Logging**: Records optimization in `.claude/optimization/DOHSYSOPTIM.md`
6. **Immediate Application**: Uses new logic for current execution

**Confirmation Format**:

```
üîç Optimization Detected: [Brief description]
   Pattern: [What was observed]
   Issue: [Current limitation]

   Proposed optimization: [Specific improvement]
   - [Implementation detail 1]
   - [Implementation detail 2]

   Update /dd:next command with this optimization? [Y/n]

   [If confirmed, logs to DOHSYSOPTIM.md with pattern details and impact metrics]
```

This command transforms TODO management from static lists into an intelligent, conversational task recommendation system
that continuously adapts to developer context and project needs through active learning.
