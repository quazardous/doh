# E001 - DOH Version 1.4.0 Release

**Epic Status**: ACTIVE  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Epic Components**: T053, T054, T055, T056, T032, T022, T024, T019, T003, T005

Complete DOH system with human-readable codebase analysis, automated build/distribution, and comprehensive
testing for stable 1.4.0 release building on the solid 1.3.0 foundation.

## Epic Phases

### Phase 1: Enhanced Analysis & Skeleton Polish (T053-T056) - 6h

- T053: Skeleton enhancement for codebase analysis integration
- T054: Advanced memory context for analysis persistence
- T055: Analysis command integration with existing `/doh:init`
- T056: Enhanced validation and methodology compliance

### Phase 2: Build & Distribution Automation (T032, T003, T005) - 12-15h

- T032: Runtime build process design and implementation
- T003: Complete architecture and distribution system
- T005: Installation and distribution scripts with cross-platform support

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance & Testing (T024, T019) - 5-7h

- T024: Comprehensive testing framework implementation
- T019: DOH system integration testing and validation

### Phase 4: Self-Hosting Integration (T022) - 2-3h

- T022: DOH system self-hosting with new analysis capabilities
