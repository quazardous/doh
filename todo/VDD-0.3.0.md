# DOH-DEV Version VDD-0.3.0 ü§ñ

**Philosophy**: Advanced multi-agent development system with intelligent collaboration  
**Target**: 2025-10-01  
**Progress**: ~0% (planning phase)

## Goals

**Must Have**:

- Advanced multi-agent collaboration system (Epic EDD091)
- Technical Project Interface Agent specialization (Claude as executive orchestrator)
- Clean context separation (executive console vs agent workspace)
- Multi-agent benchmarking and calibration framework integration
- Background agent coordination with foreground interface optimization

**Should Have**:

- Cross-project development methodology validation through benchmarks
- Advanced pair programming with specialized AI agents
- Intelligent project management automation with multi-perspective analysis
- Agent performance calibration using benchmark framework results

**Should NOT Have**:

- Runtime distribution features contamination
- Linting system modifications (perfected in VDD-0.2.0)
- Over-engineered complexity that hurts developer experience
- Agent systems that require constant manual coordination

## Constraints

- Build upon VDD-0.2.0 foundation (perfect linting + VDD-0.1.0 project isolation)
- All agent systems must enhance, not complicate, development workflow
- Context optimization must solve console noise without losing functionality
- Multi-agent systems must be benchmarked for measurable improvement over solo development

## Key Decisions

- 2025-08-29: Multi-agent systems separated from linting focus for proper development
- 2025-08-29: DD093 POC validation provides collaborative patterns foundation
- 2025-08-29: Benchmark framework (DD104) integration for agent calibration
- 2025-08-29: Executive interface specialization (DD094, DD096) as core architecture

## Strategic Evolution

**From VDD-0.2.0**: Perfect self-improving linting system  
**To VDD-0.3.0**: Multi-agent collaborative development environment with benchmarked validation  
**Future dd-0.4.0+**: Universal development platform after multi-agent validation

## Primary Epics

**Epic EDD091** - DOH-DEV Multi-Agent Development System ‚≠ê CORE FOCUS

- DD094 - Claude Context Optimization (clean console foundation)
- DD096 - Technical Project Interface Agent (executive specialization)
- DD091 - Project Management Agent implementation
- DD092 - Pair Programming methodology with agents

**Epic E104** - Benchmark Framework Integration

- DD104 - DOH Benchmark Framework & Evaluation Protocol
- Agent calibration using benchmark results for "reinventing wheel" detection
- Multi-agent vs solo development validation methodology

## Dependencies

- ‚úÖ VDD-0.2.0 complete - Perfect linting system achieved
- ‚úÖ DD093 POC validation - Multi-agent collaboration patterns proven
- üîÑ Benchmark framework (DD104) - Agent calibration and evaluation methodology
- üîÑ Context optimization research for executive vs agent workspace separation

## Success Criteria

- **Technical Project Interface Agent**: Claude specialization as executive orchestrator
- **Context Optimization**: Clean console with background agent workspace separation
- **Benchmarked Multi-Agent Validation**: Measured improvement over solo development approaches
- **Agent Calibration**: Benchmark-driven optimization for missing perspectives (market analysis, existing solutions
  research)
- **Collaborative Development**: Seamless multi-agent workflows without manual coordination overhead
