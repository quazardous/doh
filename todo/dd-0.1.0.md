# DOH-DEV Version dd-0.1.0 üõ†Ô∏è

**Philosophy**: Internal development support and command evolution
**Target**: 2025-09-01  
**Progress**: ~30% (bootstrapping phase)

## Goals

**Must Have**:

- Clear project context isolation between doh-dev and doh-runtime
- Enhanced `/doh-dev` command suite with project awareness
- Developer experience improvements for DOH system development
- Clean separation of internal tooling from runtime distribution

**Should Have**:

- Command auto-completion and beautification
- Advanced development workflow automation
- Internal testing and quality assurance tools

**Should NOT Have**:

- Runtime distribution features
- End-user facing functionality  
- Public API changes or external dependencies
- Cross-contamination with doh-runtime concerns

## Constraints

- Must maintain complete isolation from doh-runtime project context
- All internal tooling should enhance developer productivity
- Zero impact on end-user DOH runtime experience
- Focus exclusively on development support and internal workflows

## Key Decisions

- 2025-08-28: Established dual versioning system (dd-x.x.x vs doh-x.x.x)
- 2025-08-28: Project context isolation is foundational requirement
- 2025-08-28: `/doh-dev` commands operate only on internal development concerns

## Primary Epic

**E002** - DOH-DEV Internal System (handles all internal tooling development)
