### T045 - Intelligent Routing System (Bash/Claude Hybrid Execution) ðŸš©

**Status**: PROPOSED  
**Priority**: High - Epic Phase 3  
**Dependencies**: T017 (bash routine patterns), T044 (natural language design)  
**Target Version**: 1.5.0  
**Tags**: `#features` `#optimization` `#performance`

Implement hybrid execution system that intelligently routes DOH commands between optimized bash scripts and Claude
processing based on operation type, complexity, and available optimization potential.

**Impact**: Enable 100-500x performance improvements for data operations while maintaining Claude's natural language
capabilities for complex reasoning. Creates seamless user experience where speed optimization is invisible but dramatic.

**Core Architecture**:

**Routing Intelligence**:

- **Data Operations**: Route to bash (get-item, list-tasks, search, count, validate)
- **Language Processing**: Route to Claude (analysis, planning, complex queries)
- **Hybrid Operations**: Start with bash, escalate to Claude for complex cases
- **Fallback Strategy**: Always graceful fallback from bash to Claude on errors

**Performance Targets**:

- **Bash Operations**: 5-50ms response time for data queries
- **Claude Operations**: Normal API response time for reasoning tasks
- **Hybrid Decisions**: <10ms routing decision time
- **Fallback Latency**: <100ms additional overhead for bashâ†’Claude fallback

**Tasks**:

#### Phase 1: Routing Engine Core (2h)

- [ ] **Design command classification system** for bash vs Claude routing
- [ ] **Implement routing decision logic** based on command patterns and complexity
- [ ] **Create routing configuration** with per-command optimization settings
- [ ] **Build routing metadata** for command capability mapping

#### Phase 2: Bash Integration Layer (2h)

- [ ] **Create bash script discovery system** for available optimizations
- [ ] **Implement bash execution wrapper** with error handling and timing
- [ ] **Build bashâ†’Claude fallback triggers** for unsupported operations
- [ ] **Add performance monitoring** for bash operation success rates

#### Phase 3: Claude Integration Layer (1.5h)

- [ ] **Design Claude execution pathway** for complex operations
- [ ] **Implement context preservation** when falling back to Claude
- [ ] **Create Claude response optimization** for hybrid operation workflows
- [ ] **Build Claude performance tracking** for routing decision refinement

#### Phase 4: Routing Logic Implementation (2h)

- [ ] **Implement command parsing** for operation type detection
- [ ] **Create complexity analysis** for routing decisions
- [ ] **Build optimization opportunity detection** for bash routing
- [ ] **Add dynamic routing adjustment** based on performance history

#### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (1.5h)

- [ ] **Test routing accuracy** across all DOH command types
- [ ] **Validate fallback mechanisms** under various error conditions
- [ ] **Test performance improvements** for bash-routed operations
- [ ] **Verify seamless user experience** regardless of routing path

**Success Criteria**:

- 95%+ correct routing decisions for command classification
- 100-500x performance improvement for bash-routable operations
- <1% fallback failures requiring user intervention
- Transparent user experience with invisible optimization benefits

**Deliverable**: Production-ready hybrid routing system that maximizes performance while maintaining full DOH
functionality and natural language capabilities.
