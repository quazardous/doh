### T035 - Documentation Navigation & Content Organization (T034 Phase 2)

**Status**: PROPOSED  
**Priority**: Medium - User experience improvements  
**Dependencies**: T030 (critical fixes first), T034 (analysis base)  
**Proposed Version**: 1.4.0 **Tags**: `#doc` **Analysis**: Part of `analysis/T034-documentation-health-report.md`

Execute T034 Phase 2 recommendations to improve documentation navigation, content organization, and user experience
after critical architecture references are fixed by T030.

**Impact**: T034 analysis identified navigation gaps and content organization issues that affect user onboarding and
developer experience. These improvements will make the documentation more discoverable and maintainable.

**Scope (T034 Phase 2 - 3 hours total)**:

**Navigation Enhancement (1-2h)**:

- [ ] **Add document map to README.md** - Central index of all documentation
- [ ] **Improve cross-references** - Better linking between workflow docs
- [ ] **Add "See also" sections** - Help users discover related information
- [ ] **Create quick reference card** - Essential commands and workflows

**Content Organization (1-2h)**:

- [ ] **Consolidate workflow documentation** - Merge similar docs or clearly differentiate
- [ ] **Archive old analysis files** - Move development analysis to separate directory
- [ ] **Create single project structure source** - Eliminate multiple structure descriptions
- [ ] **Consolidate configuration documentation** - Reduce redundancy in config docs

**Quality Improvements**:

- Better user journey from README → productive usage → contribution
- Reduced maintenance burden through content consolidation
- Clearer information hierarchy and logical organization
- Improved discoverability of key workflows and commands

**Success Metrics**:

- New users can find relevant docs in <2 clicks from README
- No duplicate information across workflow documents
- Clear separation between user-facing and development documentation
- Logical progression from basic to advanced usage patterns

**Dependencies**: T030 must complete first to ensure all architecture references are consistent before improving
navigation.
