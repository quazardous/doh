### DOH016 - DOH Configuration Integration Validation

**Status**: Not started  
**Priority**: High - Ensure config system actually works  
**Dependencies**: DOH015 (configuration design)  
**Proposed Version**: 1.5.0

Verify that the configuration system (config.ini + doh-config.sh) integrates properly with existing DOH codebase and
scripts.

**Impact**: The new configuration system must work seamlessly with current DOH commands, scripts, and workflows. Need to
ensure existing functionality isn't broken and configuration is properly utilized.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Audit existing DOH scripts/commands for hardcoded values that should use config
- [ ] Update existing bash scripts to load and use doh-config.sh library
- [ ] Integrate config loading in get-item.sh, project-stats.sh, and other utilities
- [ ] Test configuration overrides work correctly (debug_mode, performance_tracking, etc.)
- [ ] Verify config.ini is properly created by /doh:init skeleton deployment
- [ ] Test config-manager.sh get/set/list operations on real project
- [ ] Validate config parsing with edge cases (empty values, missing sections, invalid syntax)
- [ ] Check config integration with existing environment variables (DOH_DEBUG, DOH_QUIET)
- [ ] Update existing commands to respect configuration settings
- [ ] Test end-to-end workflow: init project → modify config → run scripts

**Configuration Integration Points**:

- **Script behavior**: Debug mode, quiet mode, performance tracking should work
- **Sync settings**: GitHub/GitLab config should be readable by sync commands
- **Project metadata**: Config.ini project.name should sync with project-index.json
- **Environment variables**: Config should override or complement env vars
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback when config missing or corrupted

**Deliverable**: Fully integrated configuration system that works with all existing DOH functionality, with
comprehensive testing and validation of real-world usage.
