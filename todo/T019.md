### T019 - DOH System Integration Testing ðŸš©ðŸš©

**Status**: Proposed  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Foundation validation before T002  
**Dependencies**: T001 (skeleton), T018 (path resolution)  
**Proposed Version**: 1.4.0

Create comprehensive integration test suite to validate that all completed components work together seamlessly before
building T002 (codebase analysis).

**Impact**: With T001, T015, T016, T018 completed, we need validation that skeleton deployment, path resolution,
configuration system, and UUID generation work together across different environments.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Create test suite for skeleton deployment in various environments
- [ ] Test path resolution across symlinks, .private, bind mounts
- [ ] Validate UUID generation and project identity system
- [ ] Test configuration system with different INI scenarios
- [ ] Create automated test runner for CI/CD compatibility
- [ ] Test cross-environment compatibility (different users, paths, filesystems)
- [ ] Validate error handling and graceful degradation
- [ ] Performance testing for path resolution in large directory trees

**Deliverable**: Battle-tested DOH foundation ready for T002 codebase analysis implementation.
