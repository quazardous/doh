# DOH060 - Add Version Tracking Fields to TODO and Epic Templates ðŸ“Š

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: HIGH - Roadmap Planning Enhancement  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Epic**: EDOH074 DOH Version 1.4.0 Release - Infrastructure  
**Tags**: `#templates` `#planning` `#roadmap`  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours  
**Created**: 2025-08-28  
**Completed**: 2025-08-28  
**Version**: 1.4.0

## ðŸ“‹ Description

Add comprehensive version tracking fields to TODO and Epic templates to enable better roadmap planning, version
constraint management, and release coordination. This enhancement allows tasks to have independent status and version
lifecycles, supporting complex planning scenarios.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Current templates lack version tracking, making it difficult to:

- Plan tasks across multiple releases
- Track when features were proposed vs. targeted
- Handle version-constrained tasks (must be in specific version regardless of status)
- Coordinate Epic phases with release cycles
- Maintain clear roadmap visibility

## Version Field Definitions

### Three-Tier Version System

1. **Proposed Version**: Initial version suggestion at task/epic creation
   - Set when task is first created
   - Indicates earliest possible version for consideration
   - Can be tentative or aspirational

2. **Target Version**: Mature planning commitment
   - Set when task is actively planned
   - Indicates intended delivery version
   - Subject to change based on priorities

3. **Version**: Frozen roadmap commitment
   - Set when version is locked in roadmap
   - Immutable once set (except for major replanning)
   - Can be set even if Status is "NOT PLANNED" for constraints

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Template Updates (30min)

- [ ] **Update TODO template** with three version fields
- [ ] **Update Epic template** with version tracking
- [ ] **Add version field documentation** explaining usage
- [ ] **Create examples** showing different version scenarios

### Phase 2: Existing Task Migration (45min)

- [ ] **Analyze existing tasks** for version information
- [ ] **Add Proposed Version** to tasks based on Epic associations
- [ ] **Set Target Version** for actively planned tasks
- [ ] **Identify constrained tasks** that need frozen Version

### Phase 3: Documentation & Guidelines (30min)

- [ ] **Document version workflow** in DEVELOPMENT.md
- [ ] **Add version planning guide** for task creation
- [ ] **Update Epic templates** with phase-version mapping
- [ ] **Create version constraint examples**

### Phase 4: Integration (15min)

- [ ] **Update /doh-sys:next** to consider version fields
- [ ] **Enhance changelog** to track version movements
- [ ] **Add version validation** to task creation workflow

## Template Structure

### TODO Template Addition

```markdown
**Status**: READY / IN PROGRESS / COMPLETED / BLOCKED / NOT PLANNED  
**Priority**: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW  
**Dependencies**: T### or None  
**Epic**: E### or None  
**Tags**: `#category` `#type`  
**Estimated Effort**: X-Y hours  
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Proposed Version**: X.Y.Z or TBD  
**Target Version**: X.Y.Z or TBD  
**Version**: X.Y.Z (when frozen in roadmap)
```

### Epic Template Addition

```markdown
**Status**: PROPOSED / ACTIVE / COMPLETED  
**Priority**: P0 / P1 / P2 / P3  
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Proposed Version**: X.Y.Z - Initial version consideration  
**Target Version**: X.Y.Z - Planning commitment  
**Version**: X.Y.Z - Roadmap frozen  
**Phase Versions**:

- Phase 1: Target X.Y.Z
- Phase 2: Target X.Y+1.0
- Phase 3: Target X.Y+2.0
```

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Task Evolution

```
Created â†’ Proposed Version: 1.4.0
Planned â†’ Target Version: 1.4.0
Roadmap Lock â†’ Version: 1.4.0
Status: READY â†’ IN PROGRESS â†’ COMPLETED
```

### Scenario 2: Version Constraint

```
External dependency requires feature in 1.5.0
Status: NOT PLANNED
Version: 1.5.0 (frozen - must be in this version)
```

### Scenario 3: Deferred Task

```
Proposed Version: 1.4.0
Target Version: 1.5.0 (deferred during planning)
Version: (not set - still flexible)
Status: READY (but targeted for future)
```

### Scenario 4: Urgent Addition

```
Bug discovered post-roadmap
Proposed Version: 1.4.1
Target Version: 1.4.1
Version: 1.4.1 (fast-tracked to frozen)
Status: IN PROGRESS
```

## Benefits

- **Clear Planning Visibility**: See task progression through planning stages
- **Version Constraint Management**: Handle must-have version requirements
- **Flexible Status**: Separate readiness from version targeting
- **Roadmap Integrity**: Frozen versions provide stability
- **Historical Tracking**: See when tasks were proposed vs planned

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **Templates updated** with all three version fields
- [ ] **Existing tasks migrated** with appropriate version data
- [ ] **Documentation complete** with usage guidelines
- [ ] **Examples provided** for common scenarios
- [ ] **Integration working** with existing commands

## Implementation Notes

**Backward Compatibility**: Tasks without version fields should still work, treating them as TBD.

**Version Format**: Use semantic versioning (X.Y.Z) or "TBD" when unknown.

**Frozen Version Rules**: Once Version is set, only major replanning should change it.

**Status Independence**: Task can be NOT PLANNED but still have a frozen Version for constraints.

## Deliverable

Enhanced TODO and Epic templates with comprehensive version tracking capabilities, enabling sophisticated roadmap
planning, version constraint management, and clear visibility into task planning evolution from proposal through
delivery.
