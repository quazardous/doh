**Status**: ACTIVE  
**Priority**: HIGH ⭐ (Critical validation of DD093 PM Team value)  
**Dependencies**: DD093 (PM Team POC completed)  
**Epic**: EDD091 (DOH-DEV Multi-Agent Development System)

Benchmark multi-agent collaborative planning (PO Agent + Lead Dev Agent) against single-agent analysis using complex,
AI-challenging project scenarios to quantify real decision-making improvements and validate collaborative approach
value.

## 📊 **BENCHMARK STATUS**

**Primary Research Question**: _"Does the added complexity of multi-agent collaboration actually produce better project
decisions than skilled single-agent analysis?"_

### **Current Progress**

- ✅ **6 test cases designed**: Complex scenarios covering real-world challenges
- ✅ **6 single-agent analyses**: Complete baseline established
- 🟡 **3 multi-agent analyses**: Partial completion (missing cases 3, 4, 5)
- ❌ **Analysis incomplete**: Need to reorganize results in `./analysis/DD097-multi-agent-benchmark/`

### **Preliminary Findings** (from completed cases 1, 2, 6)

- **Quality Improvement**: +22-35% improvement observed
- **Time Overhead**: +47-56% additional analysis time
- **Business-Technical Integration**: Consistent strength of multi-agent approach
- **Decision Readiness**: Fewer follow-up questions needed

### **Next Steps Required**

1. **Reorganize structure**: Move from `./analyse/` to `./analysis/DD097-multi-agent-benchmark/`
2. **Create reusable test cases**: Extract canonical test case definitions to `shared-test-cases/`
3. **Complete missing analyses**: Create multi-agent analyses for test cases 3, 4, 5
4. **Finalize evaluation**: Complete comparative scoring for all 6 cases
5. **Generate final report**: Comprehensive benchmark results and recommendations
6. **Document reusability**: Guidelines for using test cases in future benchmarks (coding, architecture, etc.)

## 🎯 Goal

**Prove or disprove**: Multi-agent collaborative planning delivers measurably better project decisions than single-agent
analysis for complex development challenges.
