### T024 - Comprehensive Testing Framework Implementation ðŸš©

**Status**: Proposed  
**Priority**: High - Foundation for reliable DOH system  
**Dependencies**: T028 (dev environment for testing automation)  
**Proposed Version**: 1.4.0

Implement comprehensive dual testing framework: zero-credential CI/CD tests + local Claude-dependent tests with
memory-safe coverage tracking.

**Impact**: Currently DOH lacks systematic testing framework. This blocks reliable development, deployment, and prevents
regression detection. A comprehensive testing system is essential for DOH production readiness.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Implement CI/CD compatible test suite (zero credentials, zero API costs)
- [ ] Create static analysis pipeline (ShellCheck, syntax validation, JSON validation)
- [ ] Build unit test framework for bash functions and scripts
- [ ] Implement integration tests for bash-only workflows
- [ ] Create performance benchmark suite for T013 bash optimizations
- [ ] Design local testing framework for Claude-dependent functionality
- [ ] Implement mock Claude system for development testing
- [ ] Create end-to-end workflow tests with controlled Claude budget
- [ ] Build coverage registry system (guidance-only, not enforcement)
- [ ] Implement Claude-managed memory-safe coverage analysis
- [ ] Create test project fixtures and data isolation system
- [ ] Set up cross-platform testing (Linux, macOS, Windows)

**Architecture**:

```

**Testing Categories**:

**CI/CD Tests (Free, Automated)**:

- Static analysis and linting
- Pure bash function unit tests
- Bash script integration tests
- Performance benchmarks vs mocked operations
- Cross-platform compatibility
- JSON schema validation
- File structure integrity

**Local Tests (Paid, Developer-Controlled)**:

- Claude API integration validation
- Bashâ†’Claude fallback mechanism testing
- End-to-end user workflow testing
- Real Claude response format validation
- Budget-controlled comprehensive scenarios

**Coverage System**:

- Simple JSON registry for tracking coverage percentages
- Claude-managed memory-safe analysis (avoids "already analyzed" redundancy)
- Guidance-only approach (no enforcement, no commit blocking)
- Coverage dashboard and suggestions
- Gap identification and test recommendations

**Benefits**:

- **95% test coverage** from free CI/CD tests
- **5% critical validation** from controlled local tests
- **Zero API costs** in CI/CD pipeline
- **No credentials required** for automated testing
- **Air-gap compatible** CI/CD system
- **Cross-platform validated** bash compatibility
- **Memory-safe coverage** tracking with Claude intelligence
- **Developer-friendly** guidance without enforcement

**Deliverable**: Complete dual testing framework with comprehensive CI/CD automation, local Claude testing capabilities,
and intelligent coverage guidance system ready for production DOH development.
