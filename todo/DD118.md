# DD118 - Version Management System Integration & Compliance

**Status**: COMPLETED ✅  
**Priority**: HIGH ⭐ (System Integration)  
**Dependencies**: None (standalone system enhancement)  
**Epic**: EDD098 (DOH Linting System Perfection)  
**Type**: System Integration  
**Created**: 2025-08-30

## Objective

Ensure `/dd:changelog` command properly manages all version-related files and that DEVELOPMENT.md references the correct version tracking approach.

## Problem Statement

Current version management has gaps:

1. **VERSION.md Integration**: `/dd:changelog` should update `./VERSION.md` when bumping versions
2. **Documentation Awareness**: `DEVELOPMENT.md` should reference `./VERSION.md` for version tracking
3. **Version File Management**: `/dd:changelog` should manage version goal files in `todo/VDOH*` and `todo/VDD*` directories
4. **Consistency**: Version bumps should be reflected across all relevant files

## Requirements

### `/dd:changelog` Command Enhancements

1. **VERSION.md Updates**:
   - Update `./VERSION.md` when version bumps occur
   - Maintain semantic versioning format
   - Include version history/changelog references

2. **Version Goal File Management**:
   - Update `todo/VDOH-*.md` files for runtime version goals
   - Update `todo/VDD-*.md` files for DOH-DEV internal version goals  
   - Mark version files as COMPLETED when version goals achieved
   - Create new version goal files for next version milestones

3. **Cross-File Synchronization**:
   - Ensure VERSION.md, version goal files, and CHANGELOG.md stay synchronized
   - Validate version consistency across all files

### DEVELOPMENT.md Documentation Updates

1. **Version Reference Integration**:
   - Update DEVELOPMENT.md to reference `./VERSION.md` as primary version source
   - Document version goal file management workflow
   - Explain relationship between VERSION.md and todo/V* files

2. **Development Workflow**:
   - Document how version bumps trigger version goal file updates
   - Explain version milestone completion detection
   - Clarify version tracking responsibilities

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: `/dd:changelog` Enhancement
- [ ] Add VERSION.md update logic to version bump workflow
- [ ] Implement version goal file detection and management
- [ ] Add cross-file synchronization validation
- [ ] Test version bump scenarios (major/minor/patch)

### Phase 2: Documentation Integration  
- [ ] Update DEVELOPMENT.md with VERSION.md references
- [ ] Document version goal file workflow
- [ ] Add version management section to development guide
- [ ] Validate documentation accuracy

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test complete version bump workflow
- [ ] Verify all files update correctly
- [ ] Validate version consistency checks
- [ ] Document any edge cases or limitations

## Success Criteria

- [x] `/dd:changelog` updates VERSION.md during version bumps
- [x] Version goal files (todo/V*) managed automatically
- [x] DEVELOPMENT.md references VERSION.md for version tracking
- [x] All version-related files stay synchronized
- [x] Version management workflow documented clearly

## Completion Summary

**Implementation Completed (2025-08-30)**:

1. **Enhanced `/dd:changelog` Command**:
   - Added VERSION.md integration to version bump workflow
   - Implemented version goal file management (todo/VDOH*, todo/VDD*)
   - Added cross-file synchronization validation
   - Updated pipeline steps and output format

2. **Updated DEVELOPMENT.md Documentation**:
   - Added VERSION.md references as primary version source
   - Created dedicated Version Management Workflow section
   - Documented automated version management via `/dd:changelog`
   - Included practical workflow examples

3. **System Integration**:
   - VERSION.md now serves as authoritative version registry
   - Version goal files managed automatically during transitions
   - Cross-file consistency ensured (VERSION.md ↔ version goals ↔ CHANGELOG.md)
   - Comprehensive version tracking across DOH Runtime and DOH-DEV Internal projects

**Result**: Complete version management system with single source of truth (VERSION.md) and automated synchronization across all version-related files.

## Files Affected

- `.claude/commands/dd/changelog.md` (command implementation)
- `./VERSION.md` (primary version file)
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` (documentation update)
- `todo/VDOH-*.md` (runtime version goals)
- `todo/VDD-*.md` (DOH-DEV version goals)

## Notes

This task ensures comprehensive version management across the DOH development system, providing single source of truth for versions while maintaining automated synchronization of all related files.
