# DD100 - POC: Agile Workflow Implementation - Live PM-Dev Feedback Loop

**Status**: PROPOSED  
**Priority**: CRITICAL ⭐⭐ (POC for DD099)  
**Dependencies**: DD099 (Agile Workflow Evaluation)  
**Epic**: EDD091 (DOH-DEV Multi-Agent Development System)

Implement a Proof of Concept demonstrating the agile PM-Dev feedback loop system to prevent code tunnels in real
development scenarios.

## POC Objective

### Demonstrate that frequent PM-Dev checkpoints prevent code tunnels and improve alignment

Target: Complete a real task (e.g., DD087 or DD088) using the agile workflow with measurable improvements in:

- Reduced rework
- Faster completion
- Better business alignment
- Simpler solutions

## POC Scope

### **Test Case: Implement DD087 Simplified Linting Architecture**

Perfect candidate because:

- Clear business goal: "Simplify linting"
- Risk of over-engineering: Could create complex AI systems
- Existing solution available: `dev-tools/scripts/lint-files.sh`
- Measurable success: Less code = better

## POC Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Setup** (30 min)

#### **1.1 Create Agent Personas**

**PM Agent Persona**:

```markdown
You are a Product Manager focused on:

- Business value over technical complexity
- Simplicity over features
- User experience over perfect code
- Fast delivery over perfection

Your role in this task:

- Keep developer focused on DD087 goals
- Prevent over-engineering
- Ask "is there a simpler way?"
- Validate against original requirements
```

**Dev Agent Persona**:

```markdown
You are a Developer working on DD087.

Your constraints:

- 2-hour time box
- Report progress every 30 minutes
- Ask before making assumptions
- Implement simplest solution first

You must check with PM before:

- Adding new dependencies
- Creating new files
- Changing existing APIs
- Spending >30min on any subtask
```

#### **1.2 Initialize Tracking**

Create tracking file: `todo/POC-DD100-tracking.md`

```markdown
# DD100 POC Execution Log

## Task: DD087 Implementation with Agile Workflow

### Metrics to Track

- [ ] Total time
- [ ] Number of checkpoints
- [ ] Course corrections made
- [ ] Lines of code written
- [ ] Rework required
- [ ] Alignment score

### Baseline (Without Agile Workflow)

- Estimated time: 4-6 hours
- Typical result: Complex AI pipeline
- Rework common: 30-50%
```

### **Phase 2: Execute Sprint** (2 hours)

#### **Sprint Timeline**

#### T+0 min: Kickoff

```yaml
pm_brief:
  task: "DD087 - Remove dual linting systems"
  goal: "Single enforcement point using existing script"
  constraints:
    - Use existing dev-tools/scripts/lint-files.sh
    - NO new AI features
    - NO complex pipelines
    - Keep it SIMPLE
  success: "/dd:commit uses unified script"
```

#### T+30 min: Checkpoint 1

```yaml
dev_update:
  analyzed:
    - Current /dd:changelog has 4-layer AI linting
    - Found existing lint-files.sh script
  plan: "Remove AI layers, use lint-files.sh"
  questions:
    - "Should I preserve ANY AI features?"

pm_response:
  answer: "NO. Remove all AI features."
  guidance: "Simpler is better"
  continue: true
```

#### T+60 min: Checkpoint 2

```yaml
dev_update:
  completed:
    - Stripped AI linting from /dd:changelog
    - Now pure documentation updates
  working_on: "Update /dd:commit to use lint-files.sh"
  blockers: none

pm_response:
  feedback: "Perfect. Stay focused."
  warning: "Don't add features"
  continue: true
```

#### T+90 min: Checkpoint 3

```yaml
dev_update:
  completed:
    - /dd:commit uses lint-files.sh --staged
    - Git hooks are only enforcement
  testing: "Verify STRICT behavior"

pm_response:
  validation: "Show me usage example"
  request: "Demonstrate the simplification"
```

#### T+120 min: Final Review

```yaml
dev_final:
  delivered:
    - Single enforcement point
    - Uses existing script
    - No AI complexity
    - Documentation updated
  loc_changed: -500 (removed complexity)

pm_acceptance:
  status: ACCEPTED
  quality: "Exactly what was needed"
  alignment: 100%
```

### **Phase 3: Measurement & Analysis** (30 min)

#### **3.1 Collect Metrics**

```markdown
## POC Results

### With Agile Workflow

- Time: 2 hours (vs 4-6 baseline)
- Checkpoints: 4
- Course corrections: 2
- Lines removed: 500
- Lines added: 50
- Net simplification: -450 LOC
- Rework: 0%
- Alignment: 100%

### Without Agile Workflow (Typical)

- Time: 4-6 hours
- Checkpoints: 0
- Course corrections: 0
- Lines added: 500+ (new AI system)
- Rework: 30-50%
- Alignment: 60%
```

#### **3.2 Qualitative Analysis**

**What Worked**:

- Early "NO AI" guidance prevented tunnel
- 30-min checks caught complexity early
- PM kept focus on business goal
- Dev didn't over-engineer

**What Didn't**:

- Initial context setup took time
- Some checkpoints felt redundant
- Need better async communication

#### **3.3 Learnings Document**

```markdown
## DD100 POC Learnings

### Key Insights

1. **Checkpoint Frequency**
   - 30 min optimal for complex tasks
   - 60 min sufficient for simple tasks
   - 15 min for high-risk sections

2. **Communication Patterns**
   - Questions > Assumptions
   - Examples > Explanations
   - Constraints > Freedom

3. **Anti-Patterns Caught**
   - Dev started designing AI enhancement (stopped at checkpoint 1)
   - Dev considered new config system (stopped at checkpoint 2)
   - Both would have added days of work

4. **Success Factors**
   - Clear constraints upfront
   - Binary yes/no decisions
   - Focus on subtraction not addition
   - Time boxing enforced
```

## POC Success Criteria

### **Quantitative** ✅

- [ ] Complete real task in 2-hour sprint
- [ ] Zero rework required
- [ ] 50% time reduction vs baseline
- [ ] Net code reduction (simpler solution)

### **Qualitative** ✅

- [ ] PM satisfaction: "Got what I wanted"
- [ ] Dev satisfaction: "Clear direction"
- [ ] Code quality: Simple and maintainable
- [ ] Business value: Problem solved

## Implementation Checklist

### **Preparation**

- [ ] Select target task (DD087 recommended)
- [ ] Create agent personas
- [ ] Setup tracking document
- [ ] Define success metrics

### **Execution**

- [ ] Run 2-hour sprint with 4 checkpoints
- [ ] Document all PM-Dev interactions
- [ ] Track decisions and course corrections
- [ ] Measure actual vs estimated

### **Analysis**

- [ ] Compare with/without agile workflow
- [ ] Document learnings
- [ ] Identify optimal checkpoint frequency
- [ ] Refine communication patterns

### **Deliverables**

- [ ] POC execution log with timestamps
- [ ] Metrics comparison table
- [ ] Learnings document
- [ ] Recommended workflow adjustments

## Real-World Application

After successful POC, implement in production:

```bash
# New command for agile mode
/dd:dev --agile DD088
# Automatically sets up PM-Dev loop with checkpoints

# Or manual checkpoint
/dd:checkpoint
# Triggers PM review of current progress
```

## Risk Mitigation

**If POC Fails**:

- Analyze why checkpoints didn't prevent tunnel
- Adjust frequency (more/less frequent)
- Improve PM guidance clarity
- Add stronger constraints

**If Partially Successful**:

- Identify which checkpoints added value
- Remove redundant checkpoints
- Focus on high-risk decision points
- Iterate on communication format

## Expected Outcome

**Proven hypothesis**: Regular PM-Dev checkpoints prevent code tunnels and deliver better solutions faster.

**Next Steps**:

1. Run POC with DD087
2. Measure and document results
3. Refine based on learnings
4. Implement as standard workflow
5. Roll out to all agent interactions

**Deliverable**: Working proof that agile PM-Dev workflow prevents code tunnels, with metrics showing 50% time reduction
and 100% alignment.
