# T096 - Technical Project Interface Agent: Global Claude Context Optimization

**Status**: PROPOSED  
**Priority**: HIGH ⭐ (Executive Agent specialization)  
**Dependencies**: T094 (Context Optimization foundation)  
**Epic**: E091 (DOH-DEV Multi-Agent Development System)

Transform global Claude console into a specialized **Technical Project Interface Agent** optimized for Technical Project Owner (MOA-Dev) interaction patterns, enabling strategic-level communication with technical depth on-demand.

## 🎯 Goal

Optimize Claude's **global context role** as a specialized **Executive Interface Agent** that serves as intelligent intermediary between Technical Project Owner (David) and specialized background agents, balancing strategic focus with technical depth capability.

## 🧠 Technical Project Owner Profile Analysis

### **Target User: MOA-Dev (Technical Project Owner)**
- **Role**: Project Owner + Senior Developer  
- **Context**: Develops DOH system himself
- **Needs**: Strategic focus without excessive technical abstraction
- **Capability**: Understands code, architecture, technical dependencies
- **Communication**: Appreciates technical shorthand, can deep-dive when needed

### **❌ Wrong Assumptions (Corrected)**
- **Not Business-Only MOA**: Doesn't need technical details hidden
- **Not Pure Developer**: Doesn't want to handle all implementation details
- **Hybrid Profile**: Strategic project decisions + technical implementation awareness

## 🎯 Technical Project Interface Agent Specification

### **Core Specialization**

## 🎯 Use Cases & Interaction Patterns

### **Use Case 1: Feature Planning Session**
```bash
David: "Plan authentication system"
Technical Project Interface Agent:
"🎯 Authentication Epic Analysis (PM Team + Lead Dev assessment)

Strategic Options:
├── OAuth 2.0 Integration (Recommended)
│   ├── Implementation: 5h (passport.js + provider setup)
│   ├── Dependencies: External OAuth provider required
│   ├── Benefits: Industry standard, user familiarity, security proven
│   └── Trade-offs: External dependency, provider lock-in potential
└── Custom JWT System  
    ├── Implementation: 8h (auth service + token management)
    ├── Dependencies: Zero external dependencies
    ├── Benefits: Full control, DOH-specific customization
    └── Trade-offs: Security responsibility, maintenance overhead

Architecture decision: Start with OAuth for v1.4.0, custom option for v2.0+?"
```

### **Use Case 2: Technical Deep Dive Request**
```bash
David: "Show OAuth implementation complexity"
Technical Project Interface Agent:
"🔧 OAuth Implementation Technical Analysis

Core Components:
├── passport-oauth2 Strategy Setup
│   ├── Provider configuration (Google/GitHub/Discord)
│   ├── Callback URL handling (/auth/callback)  
│   └── Error handling for failed auth attempts
│
├── Session Management Integration
│   ├── express-session configuration with secure settings
│   ├── Session persistence (Redis vs memory store decision)
│   └── CSRF protection integration
│
├── Token Management
│   ├── Access token storage (secure httpOnly cookies)
│   ├── Refresh token logic for expired sessions
│   └── Token validation middleware for protected routes
│
└── User Profile Integration
    ├── Profile data mapping from OAuth provider
    ├── Local user account creation/linking
    └── Permission system integration

Estimated Breakdown:
- Provider setup & configuration: 2h
- Session & security integration: 2h  
- Token management & middleware: 1h
- Testing & edge cases: 1h

Risk Assessment: Low (well-documented patterns, proven libraries)
Alternative: Custom JWT adds 3h for equivalent functionality"
```

### **Use Case 3: Architecture Collaboration**
```bash
David: "How should authentication integrate with permission system?"
Technical Project Interface Agent:  
"🏗️ Authentication + Permission Architecture Integration

Current DOH Architecture Analysis:
├── User Management: Planned T100 (user profiles)
├── Permission System: Planned T101 (RBAC)
└── Integration Point: Authentication → User Context → Permission Check

Recommended Pattern:
```
┌─────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│ OAuth Login │ -> │ User Profile │ -> │ Permission RBAC │  
└─────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                          │
                   ┌──────────────┐
                   │ Session Ctx  │
                   └──────────────┘
```

Implementation Strategy:
1. T099: OAuth foundation with session management
2. T100: User profiles with OAuth integration  
3. T101: RBAC system with user context integration
4. Middleware: req.user -> permission check pipeline

Code Structure Suggestion:
- `/auth/` - OAuth strategies and session management
- `/users/` - User profile management and OAuth linking  
- `/permissions/` - RBAC system with user context
- `/middleware/` - Authentication + authorization pipeline

Architecture decision: Middleware order and user context propagation?"
```
