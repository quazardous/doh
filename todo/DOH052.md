### DOH052 - Codebase Analysis Integration & Reporting ðŸš©

**Status**: PROPOSED  
**Priority**: High - Epic EDOH076 Phase 4  
**Dependencies**: DOH049, DOH050, DOH051 (all analysis components)  
**Target Version**: 1.5.0  
**Epic**: EDOH076 Codebase Analysis Engine  
**Estimated Effort**: 2.5 hours

Integrate analysis components and create comprehensive reporting with natural language output.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] **Safety validation** for existing .doh projects (no overwrites)
- [ ] **Interactive refinement mode** for adjusting suggestions
- [ ] **Analysis report generation** in markdown and JSON formats
- [ ] **Natural language summary** for DOH044 integration
- [ ] **Performance optimization** for large codebases

**Deliverable**: Complete `/doh:analyze` command with integrated analysis and reporting capabilities.

**Analysis Output Structure** (for EDOH077 integration):

```json
{
  "codebase_summary": {
    "natural_description": "E-commerce platform with React frontend and Node.js microservices",
    "complexity_score": 7.5,
    "team_size_estimate": 5,
    "architecture_type": "microservices"
  },
  "suggested_epics": [
    {
      "title": "Authentication System Overhaul",
      "rationale": "High change frequency, security critical, 3 contributors",
      "estimated_effort": "3 weeks",
      "priority": "high",
      "components": ["auth-service", "user-model", "session-manager"]
    }
  ],
  "natural_language_metadata": {
    "common_terms": ["user", "product", "order", "payment"],
    "domain_context": "e-commerce",
    "team_vocabulary": ["sprint", "feature", "hotfix"]
  }
}
```

**Enhanced Features Beyond DOH002**:

- **AI-Driven Insights**: Pattern recognition for intelligent epic generation
- **Natural Language Ready**: Output formatted for DOH044 consumption
- **Team Analytics**: Collaboration patterns inform epic assignment
- **Technical Debt Mapping**: Refactoring opportunities as structured epics
- **Performance Hotspots**: Bottleneck analysis for optimization epics
- **Domain Recognition**: Identifies common patterns (e-commerce, SaaS, CRM, etc.)

**Success Criteria**:

- Analyzes codebases up to 100K lines in <30 seconds
- Generates meaningful epic suggestions with 80%+ acceptance rate
- Outputs natural language metadata for DOH044 integration
- Safely handles existing .doh projects without data loss
- Provides actionable insights even for legacy codebases

**Deliverable**: Production-ready `/doh:analyze` command that transforms existing codebases into well-structured DOH
projects with intelligent epic/task organization, providing the analysis foundation for Epic EDOH077's natural language
capabilities and completing Phase 1 of the epic.
