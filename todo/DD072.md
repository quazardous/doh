# DD072 - Rename /doh-dev Commands to /dd for Faster Typing

**Epic**: EDD075 (DOH-DEV Internal System)  
**Project**: DOH-DEV Internal (VDD-0.1.0) **Status**: COMPLETED  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated effort**: 1-2 hours  
**Tags**: #refactor #usability #commands

## Summary

Rename all `/doh-dev` command invocations to `/dd` for faster typing while maintaining "doh-dev" as the full official
name for all other components (directories, documentation, versioning).

## Context

The current `/doh-dev` command prefix is verbose for frequent usage during development. A shorter `/dd` alias would
improve developer productivity while maintaining clarity about the full system name.

## Scope

**Rename (Commands Only)**:

- `/doh-dev:commit` → `/dd:commit`
- `/doh-dev:changelog` → `/dd:changelog`
- `/doh-dev:next` → `/dd:next`
- `/doh-dev:lint` → `/dd:lint`
- All other `/doh-dev:*` commands → `/dd:*`

**Keep Unchanged (Official Names)**:

- Directory: `.claude/commands/dd/` (now renamed but "doh-dev" remains official component name)
- Documentation references to "doh-dev" system
- Version files: `dd-*.md` (already using short form)
- Internal component identification

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Command Structure

- [x] Rename command directory from `.claude/commands/doh-dev/` to `.claude/commands/dd/`
- [x] Update all command files inside directory
- [x] Verify command discovery still works

### Phase 2: Documentation Updates

- [x] Update all command usage examples in documentation
- [x] Update README.md command references (none found)
- [x] Update DEVELOPMENT.md command examples (none found)
- [x] Update task files with new command syntax

### Phase 3: Validation

- [x] Test all `/dd:*` commands work correctly
- [x] Verify no broken references in documentation
- [x] Confirm official "doh-dev" naming preserved in appropriate contexts

## Success Criteria

- [x] All commands accessible via `/dd:*` prefix
- [x] All documentation updated with new command syntax
- [x] Official "doh-dev" component naming preserved where appropriate
- [x] No broken command references or discovery issues

## Dependencies

**Depends on**: None (standalone refactoring task)  
**Blocks**: None (quality of life improvement)

## Notes

This is purely a usability improvement - the underlying functionality and official component naming remains unchanged.
The "doh-dev" name continues to represent the official system identity.
