### T044 - Natural Language DOH Command Interface & Script Optimization ⚡ (EPIC Phase 2)

**Status**: PROPOSED  
**Priority**: High - Critical for user experience and T001 enhancement  
**Dependencies**: T001 (DOH Skeleton Implementation)  
**Proposed Version**: 1.4.1  
**Epic**: E047 Natural Language & Performance Optimization  
**Tags**: `#features` `#think` `#optimization` **Analysis**: Will create
`analysis/T044-natural-language-doh-interface.md`

Design and implement natural language processing capabilities for `/doh` commands while maintaining optimal script
performance through intelligent hybrid execution strategies.

**Impact**: Current DOH commands require precise syntax and parameter knowledge, creating friction for users. T001
skeleton implementation provides foundation, but T044 focuses on making DOH commands conversational and intuitive while
preserving the performance benefits of bash script optimization where possible.

**Natural Language Vision**:

**Current Experience** (Technical):

```bash
/doh:task create --title "Fix login bug" --epic=3 --priority=high --type=bug
/doh:epic create --title "Authentication System" --description="User auth overhaul"
/doh:status update task 123 --status=completed
```

**Desired Experience** (Natural):

```bash
/doh "create a high priority bug task to fix the login issue in epic 3"
/doh "make a new epic called Authentication System for user auth overhaul"
/doh "mark task 123 as completed"
/doh "what should I work on next that's ready to start?"
/doh "show me all open bugs in the authentication epic"
```

**Technical Architecture Goals**:

**Hybrid Processing Strategy**:

- **Natural Language Parser**: Claude AI processes conversational input into structured commands
- **Intent Recognition**: Identify command type (create, update, query, analyze)
- **Parameter Extraction**: Extract entities (task names, priorities, epics, statuses)
- **Script Optimization**: Use bash for data operations, Claude for language processing
- **Fallback Graceful**: Maintain current syntax support for power users

**Performance Optimization Opportunities**:

- **Command Caching**: Cache frequently used natural language patterns → script mappings
- **Batch Operations**: "create 3 tasks for the login system" → single optimized script execution
- **Context Awareness**: Remember project context to reduce parsing overhead
- **Smart Routing**: Simple commands → direct bash, complex queries → Claude processing

**Tasks**:

#### Phase 1: Natural Language Analysis & Design (3-4h)

- [ ] **Current Command Audit**: Analyze existing `/doh` commands and usage patterns
- [ ] **Natural Language Patterns**: Research common user expressions for project management
- [ ] **Intent Classification**: Design taxonomy for DOH command intentions (create, update, query, analyze)
- [ ] **Entity Recognition**: Define entities (tasks, epics, priorities, statuses, users) and extraction patterns
- [ ] **Ambiguity Resolution**: Plan strategies for handling unclear or ambiguous natural language

#### Phase 2: Hybrid Architecture Design (2-3h)

- [ ] **Processing Pipeline**: Design NL input → intent → parameters → execution flow
- [ ] **Performance Strategy**: Plan bash optimization points vs Claude processing requirements
- [ ] **Caching Strategy**: Design pattern caching for common natural language expressions
- [ ] **Context Management**: Plan project context awareness and session memory
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Design graceful degradation when NL parsing fails

#### Phase 3: Implementation Planning & Prototyping (2-3h)

- [ ] **Command Router**: Design intelligent routing between NL processing and direct execution
- [ ] **Parser Integration**: Plan Claude AI integration points for language understanding
- [ ] **Script Interface**: Design clean interface between NL parser and existing bash scripts
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Plan benchmarking for NL vs direct command performance
- [ ] **User Experience**: Design feedback mechanisms for improving NL understanding

**Brainstorming Areas**:

**Natural Language Processing**:

- Intent recognition strategies for project management domain
- Entity extraction techniques for technical project terminology
- Context awareness across command sessions
- Ambiguity resolution through clarifying questions
- Learning from user corrections and patterns

**Performance Optimization**:

- When to use Claude AI processing vs bash scripts
- Caching strategies for common language patterns
- Batch operation optimization for multiple entity commands
- Memory usage optimization for context retention
- Response time minimization techniques

**User Experience Design**:

- Conversational flow design for complex multi-step operations
- Feedback mechanisms for command understanding accuracy
- Progressive disclosure for power users vs beginners
- Error recovery and suggestion systems
- Documentation and learning resources for natural language usage

**Integration Architecture**:

- Seamless integration with existing DOH command structure
- Backward compatibility with current precise syntax
- Extension points for future natural language capabilities
- Testing strategies for natural language processing accuracy
- Quality assurance for diverse language input patterns

**Example Natural Language Capabilities**:

**Task Management**:

- "Create a bug task to fix the search functionality"
- "Make this task high priority and assign it to the frontend epic"
- "Show me all completed tasks from last week"
- "What tasks are blocked and what's blocking them?"

**Epic/Project Planning**:

- "Start a new epic for the mobile app rewrite"
- "How many tasks are left in the authentication epic?"
- "What's the progress on the performance optimization work?"

**Workflow Queries**:

- "What should I work on next?"
- "Show me quick wins I can finish today"
- "What's ready to start that doesn't depend on other work?"
- "Give me a summary of this week's progress"

**Contextual Commands**:

- "Add three tasks for user registration: validation, database, and email confirmation"
- "Move all the CSS cleanup tasks to a new maintenance epic"
- "Mark the authentication epic as complete and archive it"

**Success Criteria**:

- Natural language processing accurately interprets 90% of common project management expressions
- Performance degradation <20% compared to direct command execution
- Seamless fallback to existing syntax when natural language parsing fails
- Context awareness improves command accuracy across conversation sessions
- User satisfaction significantly higher with natural language interface

**Performance Targets**:

- Simple NL commands (create, update): <200ms processing time
- Complex NL queries (analysis, reporting): <2s processing time
- Context retention across 50+ command session
- Cache hit rate >80% for common language patterns
- Memory footprint <50MB for context and caching

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive natural language interface design document
(`analysis/T044-natural-language-doh-interface.md`) with technical architecture, performance optimization strategies,
implementation roadmap, and user experience design for conversational DOH command interaction.
