## 🔍 Pre-computed Queries

### "high impact tasks"
1. T032 - Runtime build foundation (unlocks distribution)
2. T024 - Testing framework (enables production quality)
3. T022 - Self-hosting (validates methodology, enables distribution)

### "quick wins"  
1. T032 - Build system design (3-4h, well-scoped)
2. T024 - Testing framework (6-8h, clear architecture) 
3. T003 - Distribution system (4-6h, depends on T032)

### "version 1.4.0"
1. T032 - Build process (Phase 2, critical path)
2. T024 - Testing framework (Phase 3, quality gate)
3. T022 - Self-hosting (Phase 4, validation)
4. T003 - Distribution (Phase 2, user access)
5. T005 - Installation scripts (Phase 2, deployment)

### "build system work"
1. T032 - DOH Runtime Build Process (READY)
2. T003 - Architecture & Distribution (blocked by T032)
3. T005 - Installation/Distribution Scripts (blocked by T032, T003)

### "testing work"
1. T024 - Comprehensive Testing Framework (READY)
2. T019 - DOH System Integration Testing (blocked by foundation work)

## 📈 Strategic Sequence

### Immediate Session (4-6h available)
```text
Priority 1: T032 (3-4h) - Build foundation unlocks everything
Priority 2: Start T024 (2-3h initial) - Begin testing architecture

Alternative: T022 (8-10h) - If longer session planned, self-hosting validation
```

### Week Sequence (doh-1.4.0 focus)
```text
Week 1: T032 → T024 → T003 (Build → Test → Distribution)
Week 2: T022 → T019 → T005 (Self-hosting → Integration → Installation)
Result: Production-ready DOH 1.4.0 release
```

### Development Impact  
- **T032**: Unlocks stable distribution pipeline for all teams
- **T024**: Enables confident production deployment and maintenance
- **T022**: Validates DOH methodology through self-application
- **Combined**: Production-ready DOH system with proven architecture

## 💡 Context Patterns

### DOH Runtime Focus
- All tasks support user-facing features and production distribution
- No internal development tools (/dd:* commands excluded)
- Focus on doh-1.4.0 release stability and adoption

### Epic E074 Momentum  
- **Strong progress**: 40% completion with solid foundation (T053✅, T054✅)
- **Critical path**: T032 blocks Phase 2 entirely (build, distribution)
- **Quality gates**: T024 essential before production release
- **Validation**: T022 proves DOH works through self-application

### Version Context
- **Current Version**: doh-1.4.0 (~60% complete)
- **Must Have**: Runtime distribution, AI intelligence, professional stability  
- **Should NOT Have**: External API dependencies, breaking changes
- **Philosophy**: Transform DOH from internal tool to production runtime
