**Epic Status**: COMPLETED  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Project**: DOH-DEV Internal (VDD-0.1.0) **Epic Components**: DOH064, DD070, DD071, DD072

Internal development support system for DOH project development with enhanced tooling, project isolation, and developer
experience improvements.

## Epic Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Project Isolation (DOH064, DD070, DD071) - 7-10h

- DD071: Project context isolation for DOH-DEV vs DOH Runtime
- DOH064: Smart archive exclusion in /dd:next recommendations
- DD070: Strict linting enforcement in /dd:commit pipeline

### Phase 2: Developer Experience & Automation (DD072) - 1-2h

- DD072: Rename /doh-dev commands to /dd for faster typing
