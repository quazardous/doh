# EDD116 - DOH Development Architecture Refactoring Epic

**Status**: COMPLETED ✅  
**Priority**: HIGH ⭐ (Core Architecture)  
**Type**: EPIC (Architecture Refactoring)  
**Completed**: 2025-08-30

Complete refactoring of DOH development project architecture to establish clean, logical directory organization based on
separation-by-function principle.

## Epic Objective

Transform the DOH development project from its organic growth structure into a clean, professional architecture that:

1. **Separates by function** - Clear categorization of all components
2. **Minimizes .claude/** - Only essential Claude commands
3. **Organizes scripts logically** - All executables grouped by purpose
4. **Establishes cold storage** - Non-critical items in contrib/
5. **Ensures full compatibility** - All workflows preserved

## Architecture Vision

- Ensure 100% functionality preserved
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

### **✅ Phase 3 COMPLETED Tasks**

- Created comprehensive docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (7.5KB guide)
- Updated all project documentation for new structure
- Created docs/QUICK-REFERENCE.md for daily workflows
- Verified all command integrations work correctly
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Epic Phases

### **Phase 1: Foundation ✅ COMPLETE**

- **DD113**: Establish core script organization
- **DD114**: Validate and fix initial architecture

### **Phase 2: Migration ✅ COMPLETE**

- **DD115**: Complete dev-tools/ evacuation
- **DD117**: Validate full integration

### **Phase 3: Documentation & Polish ✅ COMPLETE**

- **EDD116 Phase 3**: Documentation alignment and command optimization

## Architecture Principles

### **1. Separation by Function**

- **scripts/[category]/** - All executables grouped by purpose
- **linting/plugins.d/** - Pure configurations only (NO scripts)
- **.claude/** - Minimal, essential commands only
- **contrib/** - Non-critical useful references

### **2. Predictable Organization**

- Developers know exactly where to find/add components
- Clear naming conventions and directory purposes
- No mixed purposes within directories

### **3. Hot vs Cold Storage**

- **Hot** (scripts/, docs/, linting/) - Daily development needs
- **Cold** (contrib/) - Useful references but not critical

### **4. Claude Independence**

- Project structure works without Claude dependencies
- .claude/ contains only interface commands
- Core functionality in standard directories

## Success Metrics

### **Structural Metrics**

- ✅ **dev-tools/ empty** - Complete migration achieved
- ✅ **scripts/ organized** - All executables properly categorized
- ✅ **linting/ clean** - No scripts in configuration directories
- ✅ **.claude/ minimal** - Only essential commands remain

### **Functional Metrics**

- ✅ **100% compatibility** - All existing workflows preserved
- ✅ **Zero broken references** - All paths updated correctly
