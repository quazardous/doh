# T085 - Implement intelligent 2-pass staging algorithm for /dd:commit --split

**Status**: COMPLETED (2025-08-28)  
**Priority**: HIGH - Critical staging logic improvement  
**Dependencies**: T084 (staging management foundation)  
**Epic**: None  
**Tags**: `#algorithm-improvement` `#staging-optimization` `#developer-intent` `#workflow`  
**Created**: 2025-08-28  

## 📋 Problem Statement

**Current Algorithm is Sub-Optimal**: The current T084 implementation has a fundamental flaw in its "Clean Working Directory" approach:

### Current Problematic Flow
```bash
# Current T084 behavior:
git add -A                    # ❌ Stage EVERYTHING first
# → Lost developer's staging intention
# → Need complex logic to "un-stage" and re-group
# → Sub-optimal commit organization
```

### Core Issues

1. **Lost Developer Intent**: `git add -A` destroys the developer's intentional staging choices
2. **Sub-Optimal Grouping**: Having to "undo" staging to create logical groups is backward
3. **Complex Logic**: Current approach requires complex staging/unstaging juggling
4. **Poor Performance**: Multiple staging operations instead of intelligent analysis

## 🎯 Solution: Intelligent 2-Pass Algorithm

### **Pass 1: Process Staged Files (Priority Intent)**
- **Respect staging intention**: Developer staged files for a reason
- **Iterative commit creation**: Find logical groups in staged files, commit each group
- **Smart extension**: Can add related unstaged files to complete logical groups
- **Progressive processing**: Stage → analyze → group → commit → repeat

### **Pass 2: Process Remaining Unstaged Files**  
- **Clean remaining modifications**: Handle unstaged files after staged intent is honored
- **Semantic grouping**: Apply same intelligent grouping to remaining files
- **Complete cleanup**: Still achieve clean working directory goal

## 🔄 Enhanced Algorithm Design

### Phase 1: Staged Files Processing (Respects Developer Intent)

```javascript
const processStagedFiles = async () => {
  let remainingStagedFiles = await getStagedFiles();
  const commits = [];
  
  while (remainingStagedFiles.length > 0) {
    // Find next logical group from staged files
    const logicalGroup = findNextLogicalGroup(remainingStagedFiles);
    
    // Smart extension: add related unstaged files if they complete the group
    const relatedUnstaged = findRelatedUnstagedFiles(logicalGroup);
    const fullGroup = [...logicalGroup, ...relatedUnstaged];
    
    // Create focused commit
    await resetStaging();
    await stageFiles(fullGroup);
    const commitHash = await createCommit(generateGroupMessage(fullGroup));
    commits.push(commitHash);
    
    // Remove processed files from remaining
    remainingStagedFiles = remainingStagedFiles.filter(f => !logicalGroup.includes(f));
  }
  
  return commits;
};
```

### Phase 2: Unstaged Files Processing (Iterative Clean Remaining)

```javascript  
const processUnstagedFiles = async () => {
  let remainingUnstagedFiles = await getUnstagedFiles();
  const commits = [];
  
  // Same iterative approach as Pass 1
  while (remainingUnstagedFiles.length > 0) {
    // Find next logical group from remaining unstaged files
    const logicalGroup = findNextLogicalGroup(remainingUnstagedFiles);
    
    // Create focused commit  
    await resetStaging();
    await stageFiles(logicalGroup);
    const commitHash = await createCommit(generateGroupMessage(logicalGroup));
    commits.push(commitHash);
    
    // Remove processed files from remaining
    remainingUnstagedFiles = remainingUnstagedFiles.filter(f => !logicalGroup.includes(f));
  }
  
  return commits;
};
```

## 💡 Intelligent Grouping Logic

### Priority-Based Group Detection

**For Staged Files (Pass 1)**:
1. **Epic/TODO completions**: `todo/*.md` with COMPLETED status
2. **Feature implementations**: Related source + test + doc files  
3. **Command enhancements**: `.claude/commands/` + related documentation
4. **Documentation updates**: Standalone doc improvements
5. **Configuration changes**: Build, package, config modifications

**Smart Extension Rules**:
- **Test files**: If `src/feature.js` staged, consider `tests/feature.test.js`
- **Documentation**: If command staged, consider related README sections  
- **Configuration**: If package.json staged, consider related config files
- **Same directory**: Files in same directory as staged files

### Example 2-Pass Workflow

```bash
# Developer has intentionally staged:
# STAGED: todo/T085.md, .claude/commands/dd/commit.md  
# UNSTAGED: README.md, tests/commit.test.js, package.json, src/utils.js

# PASS 1: Honor staging intent
Commit 1: "feat: Complete T085 staging algorithm improvement"
  Files: todo/T085.md (developer's priority)

Commit 2: "feat: Enhance /dd:commit with 2-pass staging algorithm"  
  Files: .claude/commands/dd/commit.md + tests/commit.test.js (smart extension)
  
# PASS 2: Iterative processing of remaining unstaged files
Commit 3: "docs: Update project documentation"
  Files: README.md (next logical group)
  
Commit 4: "chore: Update dependencies and utilities"  
  Files: package.json, src/utils.js (next logical group)
```

## 🎯 Simplified Mode Behaviors

### Default Mode: "Complete 2-Pass Processing"
```bash
/dd:commit --split "T085 implementation"

# Behavior:
# 1. Pass 1: Process staged files with smart extensions
# 2. Pass 2: Process remaining unstaged files iteratively  
# 3. Result: Clean directory + respected developer intent
```

### --staged: "Pass 1 Only" (Renamed from --staged-focused)
```bash
/dd:commit --split --staged "staged work only"

# Behavior:
# 1. Pass 1: Process staged files with smart extensions
# 2. No Pass 2: Stop after staged files are processed
# 3. Result: Staged intent honored, unstaged files remain
```

### --staged-only: "Pass 1 Without Extensions" (Conservative)
```bash
/dd:commit --split --staged-only "strict staged only"

# Behavior:
# 1. Pass 1: Process ONLY staged files, no smart extensions
# 2. No Pass 2: Ignore unstaged files completely
# 3. Result: Most conservative staged-only processing
```
