### T043 - DOH Security Epic Planning & Implementation Roadmap ðŸ”’

**Status**: PROPOSED  
**Priority**: High - Follow-up to T042 security analysis  
**Dependencies**: T042 (security threat model complete)  
**Epic**: Security & Hardening  
**Proposed Version**: 1.4.1 **Tags**: `#security` `#think` **Analysis**: Will create
`analysis/T043-security-epic-plan.md`

Transform T042 security analysis into comprehensive epic planning with actionable implementation roadmap for DOH system
security hardening and defensive measures implementation.

**Impact**: T042 provides threat analysis and security recommendations. T043 converts this analysis into structured epic
planning with prioritized implementation phases, specific tasks, and measurable security objectives for systematic
security enhancement.

**Epic Scope**: Create comprehensive security hardening epic encompassing:

**Security Infrastructure Epic**:

- Input validation and sanitization framework
- Secure file system access controls
- Credential management and storage security
- API security and rate limiting implementation
- Audit logging and security monitoring
- Configuration security management

**Security Integration Epic**:

- Security testing framework (SAST/DAST integration)
- Dependency security scanning automation
- Security-focused pre-commit hooks
- Developer security tooling
- Security documentation and guidelines
- Security training and awareness

**Operational Security Epic**:

- Runtime security monitoring and alerting
- Anomaly detection and threat response
- Security incident response procedures
- Security maintenance and update procedures
- Backup and recovery security measures
- User security guidelines and best practices

**Tasks**:

#### Phase 1: Epic Architecture Design (2h)

- [ ] **Analyze T042 Findings**: Extract actionable recommendations from threat model analysis
- [ ] **Epic Decomposition**: Break down security work into logical epics with clear boundaries
- [ ] **Dependency Mapping**: Identify dependencies between security implementation phases
- [ ] **Priority Framework**: Establish risk-based prioritization for security improvements
- [ ] **Resource Planning**: Estimate effort and timeline for security implementations

#### Phase 2: Task Breakdown Structure (2-3h)

- [ ] **Security Infrastructure Tasks**: Define specific tasks for core security controls
- [ ] **Security Integration Tasks**: Plan security tooling and automation tasks
- [ ] **Operational Security Tasks**: Design security monitoring and response tasks
- [ ] **Testing & Validation Tasks**: Plan security testing and validation approach
- [ ] **Documentation Tasks**: Outline security documentation requirements

#### Phase 3: Implementation Planning (1-2h)

- [ ] **Phase Sequencing**: Order security implementation phases for maximum impact
- [ ] **Milestone Definition**: Define measurable security milestones and success criteria
- [ ] **Risk Mitigation Timeline**: Plan timeline for addressing highest-risk vulnerabilities first
- [ ] **Integration Strategy**: Plan integration with existing DOH development workflow
- [ ] **Success Metrics**: Define KPIs for measuring security improvement effectiveness

**Brainstorming Focus**:

**Epic Structure Design**:

- How to organize security work into manageable, logical epics
- Dependencies and sequencing between security implementation phases
- Resource allocation and timeline estimation for security work
- Integration with existing DOH development priorities

**Implementation Strategy**:

- Minimum viable security (MVS) approach for rapid threat mitigation
- Progressive security enhancement roadmap
- Security testing integration with development workflow
- User impact minimization during security improvements

**Success Criteria**:

- Comprehensive security epic plan created with clear implementation phases
- Risk-prioritized task breakdown with effort estimates
- Timeline and milestone plan for security implementation
- Integration strategy with existing DOH development workflow
- Measurable security objectives and success metrics defined

**Deliverable**: Detailed security epic plan (`analysis/T043-security-epic-plan.md`) with structured implementation
roadmap, prioritized task breakdown, timeline planning, and measurable security objectives for systematic DOH system
hardening.
