## Command Execution Flow

### **Phase 1: PO Agent Analysis** 
```bash
Input: "plan authentication system"

PO Agent Analysis:
"üìã **Feature Analysis: Authentication System**

**User Story Breakdown**:
1. **Core Authentication**
   - As a user, I want to log in securely so that I can access my personalized experience
   - As a user, I want to stay logged in across sessions so that I don't need to re-authenticate constantly

2. **Account Management** 
   - As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access if I forget it
   - As a user, I want to manage my profile information so that my account stays up to date

3. **Security Features**
   - As a user, I want secure logout so that others cannot access my account on shared devices
   - As an admin, I want to prevent brute force attacks so that user accounts remain secure

**Questions for Technical Project Owner**:
- What user types need authentication? (regular users, admin, API clients)
- What's the expected user volume? (affects scalability decisions)
- Any specific security requirements? (2FA, enterprise SSO, compliance needs)
- Integration requirements? (existing systems, third-party services)

**Priority Assessment**: 
- Critical path feature (blocks user personalization)
- High user impact (affects every user interaction)
- Foundation for other features (permissions, user data, etc.)"
```

### **Phase 2: Lead Dev Agent Assessment**
```bash
Lead Dev Agent Assessment:
"üîß **Technical Feasibility: Authentication System**

**Architecture Options**:

**Option 1: OAuth 2.0 Integration** (Recommended)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Implementation: 5-6 hours
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dependencies: External OAuth provider (Google, GitHub, Discord)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Benefits: Industry standard, proven security, user familiarity
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Risks: External dependency, provider-specific quirks
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Best for: Quick implementation, standard security needs

**Option 2: Custom JWT System**
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Implementation: 8-10 hours  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dependencies: None (full control)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Benefits: Complete customization, no external dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Risks: Security responsibility, more maintenance overhead
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Best for: Specific requirements, full control needs

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Implementation: 6-8 hours
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dependencies: OAuth for social login + local accounts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Benefits: Flexibility, multiple authentication paths
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Risks: Complexity, multiple systems to maintain
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Best for: Diverse user base, multiple use cases

**Technical Considerations**:
- **Session Management**: Express-session vs JWT tokens vs Redis store
- **Security**: HTTPS required, secure cookie settings, CSRF protection
- **Database**: User table schema, password hashing (bcrypt), session storage
- **Integration Points**: Middleware setup, protected route patterns

**Complexity Assessment**:
- Low complexity: OAuth integration (well-documented, proven patterns)
- Medium complexity: Custom JWT (security implementation details)
- High complexity: Multi-provider hybrid (coordination between systems)

**Recommendation**: Start with OAuth 2.0 for v1.4.0, evaluate custom system for v2.0+ if needed"
```

### **Phase 3: Collaborative Decision Framework**
```bash
Technical Project Owner Decision Points:
"‚öñÔ∏è **Decision Required: Authentication Approach**

**PO Agent Recommendation**: OAuth 2.0 
- Faster user onboarding (familiar login flow)
- Reduced friction (no new account creation required)
- Security handled by proven providers

**Lead Dev Agent Recommendation**: OAuth 2.0
- 5-6 hour implementation vs 8-10 hours custom
- Proven security patterns, less security responsibility
- Good documentation and community support

**Strategic Decision Needed**:
1. **Provider Choice**: Google, GitHub, Discord, or multiple?
2. **Fallback Strategy**: Local accounts as backup option?
3. **Implementation Priority**: v1.4.0 or can be deferred?
4. **User Experience**: Social login only vs hybrid approach?

**Technical Project Owner Decision**: [Awaiting your input]"
