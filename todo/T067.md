# T067 - Design DOH Runtime Release & Version Lifecycle Management System ðŸš€

**Status**: READY  
**Priority**: HIGH - Product Management & Distribution  
**Dependencies**: None (strategic planning task)  
**Epic**: E001 DOH Version 1.4.0 Release - Phase 4  
**Tags**: `#lifecycle` `#versioning` `#releases` `#product-management` `#distribution`  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours  
**Created**: 2025-08-28  
**Proposed Version**: 1.4.0  

## ðŸ“‹ Description

Design and brainstorm a comprehensive release and version lifecycle management system for the DOH runtime distribution. Focus on how DOH handles version expectations, compatibility, updates, deprecation cycles, and user communication throughout the product lifecycle - from development through stable releases to end-of-life.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

As DOH evolves from development project to distributed runtime, we need systematic approaches to:

**Current Gap**:
- No clear versioning strategy for DOH runtime releases
- Unclear how users should expect version compatibility and stability
- No defined lifecycle stages or communication strategy
- Unknown how to handle breaking changes and deprecation
- Missing update mechanisms and user notification systems

**Target System**:
- Clear versioning semantics that users can rely on
- Defined lifecycle stages with clear expectations per stage
- Systematic approach to compatibility, breaking changes, and deprecation
- User communication strategy for updates, changes, and lifecycle transitions
- Technical mechanisms for version management and distribution

## Core Brainstorming Areas

### 1. Version Semantics & Strategy

**Semantic Versioning Application for DOH:**
- **Major (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes, new lifecycle stage, major feature sets
- **Minor (X.Y.0)**: New features, backward compatible, enhanced capabilities
- **Patch (X.Y.Z)**: Bug fixes, documentation improvements, minor enhancements

**DOH-Specific Version Considerations:**
- Runtime compatibility vs development compatibility
- Command interface stability vs internal implementation changes
- Configuration format versioning and migration
- Plugin/extension compatibility expectations

**Version Communication Strategy:**
- How users understand what each version means
- Release notes and changelog standards
- Breaking change communication timeline
- Deprecation warning systems

### 2. Release Lifecycle Stages

**Development Lifecycle Stages:**
```
Development â†’ Alpha â†’ Beta â†’ Release Candidate â†’ Stable â†’ Maintenance â†’ End-of-Life
```

**Stage Definitions for DOH Context:**
- **Development (0.x.x)**: Active development, no stability guarantees
- **Alpha (1.0.0-alpha.x)**: Feature complete, testing needed, breaking changes possible
- **Beta (1.0.0-beta.x)**: Feature frozen, bug fixes only, API stability focus
- **Release Candidate (1.0.0-rc.x)**: Production ready candidate, final validation
- **Stable (1.x.x)**: Production ready, backward compatibility commitment
- **Maintenance**: Security fixes and critical bugs only
- **End-of-Life**: No updates, migration path provided

### 3. Compatibility & Breaking Changes

**Compatibility Matrix:**
- **Backward Compatibility**: What we promise to maintain across versions
- **Forward Compatibility**: How new versions handle old configurations/data
- **Runtime vs Development Compatibility**: Different expectations for each

**Breaking Change Management:**
- **Detection**: How to identify breaking changes during development
- **Documentation**: How to communicate breaking changes to users
- **Migration**: Tools and guides for users to adapt to breaking changes
- **Timeline**: Deprecation periods and sunset schedules

**Deprecation Strategy:**
- **Warning Systems**: How users learn about deprecated features
- **Grace Periods**: How long deprecated features remain functional
- **Migration Paths**: Clear paths from deprecated to new approaches

### 4. User Communication & Expectations

**Release Communication:**
- **Release Notes**: Structure, content, and distribution
- **Migration Guides**: Step-by-step upgrade instructions
- **Breaking Change Announcements**: Timeline and communication channels
- **Version Roadmaps**: Future version planning and feature previews

**User Expectation Management:**
- **Stability Promises**: What guarantees we make per version
- **Support Lifecycle**: How long versions are supported
- **Update Recommendations**: When users should upgrade
- **Risk Assessment**: Help users understand upgrade risks

### 5. Technical Implementation

**Version Detection & Management:**
- **Runtime Version Checking**: How DOH knows its own version
- **Compatibility Validation**: How DOH validates configuration/data compatibility
- **Update Mechanisms**: How users can upgrade DOH installations
- **Multi-Version Support**: Supporting multiple DOH versions simultaneously

**Distribution Strategy:**
- **Release Packaging**: How versions are packaged and distributed
- **Installation Methods**: Package managers, direct downloads, etc.
- **Rollback Capabilities**: How users can revert problematic upgrades
- **Security Updates**: Fast-track security patch distribution

## Key Questions to Address

### Product Strategy Questions
- What stability promises should DOH make to users at different lifecycle stages?
- How do we balance innovation velocity with user stability expectations?

- What's our strategy for migrating user data and configurations across versions?

### User Experience Questions
- How do users learn about new versions and decide whether to upgrade?
- What information do users need to assess upgrade risks?
- How do we minimize friction in the upgrade process?
- What fallback options do users need if upgrades cause problems?
- How do we communicate lifecycle transitions (e.g., moving to maintenance mode)?
