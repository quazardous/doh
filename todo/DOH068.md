# DOH068 - Implement Version Goal Philosophy & Version Management in DOH Task System üéØ

**Project**: DOH Runtime **Status**: READY **Priority**: HIGH - Project Management & Strategic Planning
**Dependencies**: None (foundational enhancement) **Epic**: EDOH074 DOH Runtime VDOH-1.4.0 Release - Phase 4 **Tags**:
`#versioning` `#project-management` `#epics` `#strategy` `#documentation` **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours **Created**:
2025-08-28 **Proposed Version**: 1.4.0

## üìã Description

Implement an explicit version goal and philosophy management system within the DOH task/epic framework. Each version
will have a dedicated `version-X.Y.Z.md` file in the `todo/` folder that captures the strategic goals, philosophy, and
key information about that version's development. This creates a living document that evolves throughout the version's
lifecycle.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Currently, version goals and philosophy are scattered across various TODOs, epics, and documentation:

**Current Gap**:

- No central place to define what a version is trying to achieve
- Version philosophy and goals get lost in task details
- Difficult to maintain strategic focus during development
- No clear way to capture version-specific insights as they emerge
- Missing connection between high-level goals and individual tasks

**Target System**:

- Dedicated `version-X.Y.Z.md` files for each active version
- Clear version goals, philosophy, and success criteria
- Living document that captures insights during development
- Archive system for completed versions (stable+)
- Strategic alignment tool for task/epic planning

## Core Functionality

### 1. Version File Structure (Keep it SHORT - ~30 lines max)

**Location**: `todo/version-X.Y.Z.md` for active development versions

**Concise Template**:

```markdown
# Version X.Y.Z üéØ

**Philosophy**: [One-line strategic vision] **Target**: YYYY-MM-DD **Status**: PLANNING | DEVELOPMENT | TESTING | STABLE
**Progress**: ~XX% (rough estimate, optional)

## Goals

**Must Have**:

- [High-level goal, not task list]
- [Strategic objective]
- [Core capability]

**Should Have**:

- [Nice-to-have feature]
- [Stretch goal if time permits]

**Should NOT Have**:

- [Explicitly out of scope]
- [Feature to avoid/postpone]
- [Complexity to reject]

## Constraints

- [Technical boundary]
- [Design constraint]
- [Compatibility requirement]

## Key Decisions

- YYYY-MM-DD: [Important strategic decision]
- YYYY-MM-DD: [Architecture choice]
- YYYY-MM-DD: [Priority shift]

## Primary Epic

**E###** - [Epic that manages this version's execution]

---

_Strategic goals only. Epic handles all tactical planning._
```

**IMPORTANT**:

- ‚ùå DO NOT list TODOs or tasks (unless one TODO IS the version, e.g., "Version 2.0 = DOH063 Architecture Refactor")
- ‚ùå DO NOT duplicate epic/task specifications
- ‚úÖ DO capture high-level goals and philosophy
- ‚úÖ DO record key strategic decisions
- ‚úÖ DO keep it concise (~30 lines maximum)
- ‚úÖ Progress % is LOOSE estimate with brief note (e.g., "~60% - AI done, distribution pending")
- ‚ùå DO NOT track detailed progress - that's the Epic's job

### 2. Version Lifecycle Management

**Active Development Versions** (in `todo/`):

- Current development version (e.g., 1.4.0)
- Current stable version (e.g., 1.3.0)
- Next planned version (e.g., 1.5.0) if planning started

**Archive Policy** (to `todo/archive/`):

- Archive when the NEXT version becomes stable
- Example: When 1.5.0 ‚Üí STABLE, then archive 1.4.0
- Keep one stable version as reference
- Archived versions remain searchable

### 3. Hierarchy & Coupling

**Clear Separation of Concerns**:

```
Version (Strategic) ‚Üí Epic (Tactical) ‚Üí Tasks (Implementation)
```

**Version Level** (very high level):

- Strategic goals and philosophy
- Can reference key epics (e.g., "EDOH074 is the main epic for 1.4.0")
- Defines what's IN and OUT of scope
- NO phase planning or task details

**Epic Level** (manages execution):

- Handles ALL phasing and roadmap planning
- Manages task dependencies and scheduling
- Tracks progress and completion
- Owns the tactical implementation plan

**Coupling Rules**:

- Version CAN reference epic (e.g., "Primary epic: EDOH074")
- Epic MANAGES all phases and task organization
- Version stays strategic, Epic handles tactical

### 4. Version Goal Philosophy

**What Version Files ARE**:

- Strategic vision and constraints
- High-level goals (not task lists)
- Explicit exclusions ("Should NOT Have")
- Major strategic decisions only

**What Version Files are NOT**:

- Phase planning documents
- Task roadmaps or schedules
- Progress trackers
- Epic/task lists
- Detailed implementation plans

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Design & Structure (1h)

- [ ] **Create version file template** with comprehensive structure
- [ ] **Define version lifecycle states** and transition criteria
- [ ] **Design archive policy** for stable versions
- [ ] **Plan integration points** with existing DOH systems
- [ ] **Create example version file** for 1.4.0

### Phase 2: Implementation (1h)

- [ ] **Create `todo/version-1.4.0.md`** with current version goals
- [ ] **Update `/doh-sys:next`** to read version files for context
- [ ] **Enhance task creation** to reference version goals
- [ ] **Add version awareness** to epic management
- [ ] **Create archive migration** script for old versions

### Phase 3: Integration & Documentation (1h)

- [ ] **Update DOH documentation** with version philosophy
- [ ] **Create workflow guide** for version file management
- [ ] **Add version commands** if needed (e.g., `/doh:version`)
- [ ] **Test integration** with existing task/epic workflow
- [ ] **Document best practices** for version goal setting

## Implementation Examples

### Example: version-1.4.0.md (Concise Format)

```markdown
# Version 1.4.0 üéØ

**Philosophy**: Transform DOH from internal tool to production runtime with AI intelligence **Target**: 2025-09-15
**Progress**: ~60% (AI features done, distribution pending)

## Goals

**Must Have**:

- Runtime distribution system ready for projects
- AI-powered task and commit intelligence
- Professional documentation and stability

**Should Have**:

- Natural language interfaces
- Testing framework
- Command auto-completion

**Should NOT Have**:

- External API dependencies
- Complex configuration requirements
- Breaking changes to existing /doh commands

## Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing /doh commands
- Zero external dependencies for runtime (bash + jq only)
- All features must work offline (no external API calls)
- Keep simple for small projects, scale for large ones

## Key Decisions

- 2025-08-28: Prioritize AI intelligence over traditional features
- 2025-08-28: Semantic commit splitting should be default behavior
- 2025-08-28: Defer complex multi-project features to 2.0

## Primary Epic

**EDOH074** - DOH Version 1.4.0 Release (manages phases & execution)

---

_Strategic goals only. EDOH074 handles all tactical planning._
```

### Example: Version Constraint Check

When creating a task, check version constraints:

```bash
# During task creation
/doh-sys:create-task "Cloud sync feature"

# System checks version-1.4.0.md and warns:
"Warning: 'External API dependencies' is in Should NOT Have for v1.4.0.
This feature may need to be deferred to v2.0."
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **Version file template** created and documented
- [ ] **Current version file** (1.4.0) created with goals and philosophy
- [ ] **Archive system** implemented for old stable versions
- [ ] **Integration complete** with task/epic creation workflow
- [ ] **Living document** practice established with regular updates
- [ ] **Version awareness** added to `/doh-sys:next` recommendations
- [ ] **Documentation updated** with version management workflow

## Benefits & Impact

- **Strategic Clarity**: Clear version goals guide development decisions
- **Knowledge Capture**: Insights and learnings preserved for future reference
- **Alignment**: All tasks/epics connect to version philosophy
- **Focus**: Team stays aligned on version objectives
- **Historical Record**: Version evolution documented for project history
- **Decision Support**: Philosophy guides feature inclusion/exclusion decisions

## Integration Points

- **Enhances**: DOH067 version lifecycle management with goal documentation
- **Supports**: Epic/task creation with version context
- **Enables**: Strategic planning for future versions
- **Complements**: `/doh-sys:next` with version-aware recommendations

## Version Management Workflow

### Creating New Version

1. **Planning**: Create `version-X.Y.Z.md` with goals and constraints
2. **Development**: Add only MAJOR strategic decisions (rare)
3. **Release**: Mark as STABLE, keep for reference
4. **Archive**: Move to `todo/archive/` when NEXT version becomes stable

### Usage (NOT for daily management)

- **Strategic Decisions**: "Should we add feature X?" ‚Üí Check Should NOT Have
- **Scope Questions**: "Is this for 1.4 or 2.0?" ‚Üí Check version constraints
- **Priority Conflicts**: Reference Must Have vs Should Have
- **NOT for**: Task scheduling, progress tracking, roadmap planning

## Archive Management

**Archive Structure**:

```
todo/archive/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ version-1.0.0.md  # Archived when 1.2.0 became stable
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ version-1.1.0.md  # Archived when 1.3.0 became stable
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ version-1.2.0.md  # Archived when 1.4.0 became stable
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**Archive Timeline Example**:

- 1.4.0 DEVELOPMENT ‚Üí Keep 1.3.0 (stable) as reference
- 1.4.0 ‚Üí STABLE ‚Üí Keep both 1.3.0 and 1.4.0
- 1.5.0 ‚Üí STABLE ‚Üí Archive 1.4.0, keep 1.5.0
- Always have current stable + maybe next in `todo/`

## Deliverable

Complete version goal and philosophy management system integrated into DOH task/epic framework. Includes template
structure, current version file (1.4.0), archive system for old versions, and integration with existing DOH commands.
The system provides strategic alignment, knowledge capture, and living documentation that evolves throughout each
version's lifecycle.

This creates a powerful tool for maintaining strategic focus while capturing valuable insights and decisions as they
occur during development, ensuring each version has clear purpose and measurable success criteria.
