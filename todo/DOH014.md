### DOH014 - DOH Data Structure Analysis for Scripting

**Status**: Not started  
**Priority**: Medium - Foundation for performance optimization  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Proposed Version**: 1.5.0

Analyze and document DOH data structures to identify optimal patterns for bash script automation and determine
standardization needs.

**Impact**: Current DOH data structures may not be optimized for bash parsing. Understanding the data patterns, file
formats, and access patterns will enable efficient script creation and identify potential structure improvements.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Audit current data structures (project-index.json, MD files, memory files)
- [ ] Map all data access patterns currently requiring Claude calls
- [ ] Identify complex vs simple data extraction operations
- [ ] Document JSON schema patterns and nested structures
- [ ] Analyze file naming conventions and directory structures
- [ ] Identify inconsistencies or parsing difficulties in current formats
- [ ] Recommend data structure optimizations for bash-friendly access
- [ ] Create data access frequency analysis (which operations are most common)
- [ ] Design standardized interfaces for script-friendly data access
- [ ] Prototype key data extraction patterns with bash/jq

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive analysis document with data structure documentation, bash-scripting recommendations, and
standardized data access patterns ready for DOH013 implementation.
