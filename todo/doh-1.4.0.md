# DOH Runtime Version doh-1.4.0 ðŸŽ¯

**Philosophy**: Transform DOH from internal tool to production runtime with AI intelligence
**Target**: 2025-09-15
**Progress**: ~60% (rough estimate)

## Goals

**Must Have**:

- Runtime distribution system ready for projects
- AI-powered task and commit intelligence
- Professional documentation and stability

**Should Have**:

- Natural language interfaces
- Testing framework
- Command auto-completion

**Should NOT Have**:

- External API dependencies
- Complex configuration requirements
- Breaking changes to existing /doh commands

## Constraints

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing /doh commands
- Zero external dependencies for runtime (bash + jq only)
- All features must work offline (no external API calls)
- Keep simple for small projects, scale for large ones

## Key Decisions

- 2025-08-28: Prioritize AI intelligence over traditional features
- 2025-08-28: Semantic commit splitting should be default behavior
- 2025-08-28: Defer complex multi-project features to 2.0

## Primary Epic
