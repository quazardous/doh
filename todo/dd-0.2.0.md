# DOH-DEV Version dd-0.2.0 üéØ

**Philosophy**: Perfect linting system with intelligent automation and feedback learning  
**Target**: 2025-09-10  
**Progress**: ~20% (Epic E098 in progress)  

## Goals

**Must Have**:

- Perfect self-improving linting with intelligent feedback (Epic E098 completion)
- Pattern recognition for manual intervention reduction  
- Custom plugin development pipeline for recurring patterns
- Automated writing guidelines maintenance
- Data-driven linting optimization based on Claude feedback

**Should Have**:

- 90% reduction in manual linting interventions through learning
- Extensible architecture for future linting domains beyond markdown
- Integration with existing T087/T088 STRICT enforcement backend
- Real-time pattern detection and custom rule generation

**Should NOT Have**:

- Multi-agent systems (deferred to dd-0.3.0)
- Complex agent orchestration or collaboration features  
- Context management beyond linting scope
- Over-engineered solutions that require constant maintenance

## Constraints

- Build upon dd-0.1.0 foundation (100% complete project isolation)
- Focus exclusively on linting domain - no feature creep into other areas
- Learning systems must be data-driven and measurably reduce manual interventions
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing T087/T088 STRICT enforcement system

## Key Decisions

- 2025-08-29: Focus dd-0.2.0 exclusively on linting perfection (Epic E098)
- 2025-08-29: Multi-agent systems deferred to dd-0.3.0 for proper focus separation
- 2025-08-29: T103 Intelligent Linting Feedback System becomes core feature
- 2025-08-29: Markdown-first approach with extensible architecture for future domains

## Strategic Evolution

**From dd-0.1.0**: Basic internal tooling and project isolation  
**To dd-0.2.0**: Perfect self-improving linting system with intelligent automation  
**To dd-0.3.0**: Multi-agent collaborative development environment (future)

## Primary Epic

**Epic E098** - DOH Linting System Perfection ‚≠ê CORE FOCUS

- T103 - Intelligent Linting Feedback System (NEW - pattern recognition)
- T089 - Perfect System with Exception Management (PROPOSED)  
- T087 - STRICT Enforcement Architecture ‚úÖ (COMPLETED - foundation)
- T088 - Enhanced Multi-Linting Script ‚úÖ (COMPLETED - backend)

## Dependencies

- ‚úÖ dd-0.1.0 complete - Project isolation and enhanced commands achieved  
- ‚úÖ T087, T088 complete - STRICT linting enforcement backend ready
- üîÑ Pattern collection from manual Claude linting interventions

## Success Criteria

- **Pattern Recognition**: System learns from 50+ manual Claude linting interventions
- **Custom Plugin Pipeline**: Automated creation of plugins for recurring patterns  
- **90% Intervention Reduction**: Measurable decrease in manual linting corrections
- **Extensible Architecture**: Framework ready for future linting domains beyond markdown
- **Self-Improving Learning**: System gets better with each manual intervention analyzed
