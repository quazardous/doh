### DOH030 - Fix Single Source of Truth violations in CLAUDE.md after DOH026 completion

**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Priority**: HIGH - Critical for 1.4.0 release consistency  
**Dependencies**: DOH026 (restructuring completion ‚úÖ), DOH034 (analysis completed ‚úÖ)  
**Version**: 1.4.0 **Tags**: `#doc` **Analysis**: Part of `analysis/DOH034-documentation-health-report.md`

Fix Single Source of Truth violations in CLAUDE.md and execute critical architecture reference cleanup identified by
DOH034 comprehensive documentation audit. This is now a critical 1.4.0 blocker due to 89 outdated architecture
references found.

**Impact**: DOH034 analysis revealed critical issues beyond CLAUDE.md - 89 outdated architecture references across 15
files create user confusion and command failures. This expanded scope makes it a 1.4.0 release blocker.

**Critical Issues Identified by DOH034**:

1. **Architecture References (89 total across 15 files)**:
   - "skel/" references: 47 occurrences
   - "templates/" references: 31 occurrences
   - "controlled duplication": 11 occurrences
   - Files: CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/architecture.md, TODO.md, TODOARCHIVED.md, .claude/commands/doh/init.md, others

2. **Version Inconsistencies**:
   - JSON examples using "version": "1.0.0" instead of "1.4.0"
   - Mixed version references across documentation
   - Files: docs/architecture.md:112, analysis/DOH014-data-structure-analysis.md:39, .claude/commands/doh/agent.md:392

3. **Most Critical Files (per DOH034)**:
   - CONTRIBUTING.md:90 - Shows old project structure with `skel/`
   - docs/architecture.md:30,34 - References `.claude/doh/templates/`
   - .claude/commands/doh/init.md:216-217 - References old structure

4. **Impact Assessment**:
   - User confusion from inconsistent structure information
   - Command failures from references to non-existent paths
   - Maintenance burden from multiple sources of truth
   - Risk of information drift and inconsistency

**Tasks (DOH034 Phase 1 - Critical Architecture Cleanup)**:

**High Priority (1.4.0 Blockers)**:

- [ ] **CONTRIBUTING.md:90** - Fix project structure section showing old `skel/` structure
- [ ] **docs/architecture.md:30,34** - Remove references to `.claude/doh/templates/`
- [ ] **CLAUDE.md** - Remove outdated DOH system structure and duplicated planning sections
- [ ] **.claude/commands/doh/init.md:216-217** - Update structure references
- [ ] **Version consistency** - Update JSON examples from "1.0.0" to "1.4.0" in 3 files

**Medium Priority (Quality)**:

- [ ] **TODO.md architecture sections** - Add deprecation notices to old strategy references
- [ ] **TODOARCHIVED.md** - Add clear deprecation notices for controlled duplication strategy
- [ ] **Cross-reference audit** - Scan remaining 10 files with architecture references
- [ ] **Navigation improvements** - Add document map to README.md per DOH034 recommendations

**Proposed CLAUDE.md Changes**:

Replace sections with:

```markdown
## DOH System Structure

üìÅ **Current Structure**: See `TODO.md` DOH026 for complete system organization and migration status.

## Task Management

This project uses traditional TODO.md (in project root) for development tasks rather than the /doh system it provides to
other projects.

üìã **Version Management Rules**: See `TODO.md` section "TODO Management" üìÅ **System Structure**: See `TODO.md` DOH026
for current organization
```

**Single Source of Truth Enforcement**:

- TODO.md = Source of truth for development tasks, planning, and system structure
- CLAUDE.md = Configuration and brief references only
- No duplication of detailed information between files

**Benefits**:

- Single maintenance point for system structure
- No risk of information drift between files
- Cleaner CLAUDE.md focused on configuration
- Easier updates when structure evolves

**Deliverable**: CLAUDE.md with all Single Source of Truth violations fixed, containing only brief references to TODO.md
for detailed information, ensuring no duplication of system structure or planning details.
