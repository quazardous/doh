### T025 - Move TODO.md from .claude/doh to project root ✅

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED 2025-08-27  
**Priority**: Medium - DOH self-hosting preparation  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Version**: 1.4.0 **Completed**: 2025-08-27

Move the TODO.md file from `.claude/doh/TODO.md` to the project root directory to prepare for DOH self-hosting and make
development tasks more accessible.

**Impact**: As DOH becomes its own standalone project, development tracking should be at the root level rather than
buried in `.claude/doh/`. This aligns with conventional project structure and prepares for T022 self-hosting.

**Benefits**:

- More accessible development tracking
- Conventional project structure
- Preparation for DOH self-hosting (T022)
- Easier for contributors to find development tasks

**Deliverable**: ✅ COMPLETED TODO.md moved to project root with all references updated and functionality preserved.
