### DOH034 - Documentation Health Check & Content Review

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Priority**: Medium - Comprehensive documentation audit  
**Dependencies**: None (can be done independently), DOH030 (cross-check coordination)  
**Version**: 1.4.0 **Tags**: `#think` **Analysis**: `analysis/DOH034-documentation-health-report.md`

Conduct comprehensive brainstorming and health check of all project documentation to ensure content is useful,
well-balanced, up-to-date, and eliminates redundancy or outdated information after the recent architecture changes.

**Impact**: Recent architectural changes (DOH026 restructuring, DOH033 single source strategy) may have created
documentation inconsistencies, outdated references, or gaps. A systematic review ensures all documentation serves its
purpose and guides users/developers effectively.

**Cross-Check Coordination with DOH030**: This task works in coordination with DOH030 (CLAUDE.md cleanup) to ensure
comprehensive documentation health. DOH034 provides the broader audit while DOH030 handles specific CLAUDE.md fixes. Both
tasks should be completed together for maximum effectiveness.

**Scope of Review**:

**Project Root Documentation**:

- `README.md` - Project overview and quick start
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Feature tracking and version history
- `VERSION.md` - Version management
- `WORKFLOW.md` - User workflow guide
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI/development configuration
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Developer guidelines
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guide

**Documentation Directories**:

- `docs/` - Technical documentation (12 files)
- `analysis/` - Development analysis (2 files)
- `.claude/doh/inclaude.md` - Runtime documentation

**Brainstorming Questions**:

**Content Usefulness**:

- Which documents provide immediate value to users vs developers?
- Are there documents that duplicate information?
- What gaps exist for new contributors or users?
- Which files are actually referenced/used vs ignored?

**Balance Assessment**:

- Is there too much technical detail in user-facing docs?
- Are developer docs comprehensive enough?
- Do we have the right mix of guides vs reference material?
- Are examples practical and current?

**Currency Check**:

- Which documents reference old architecture (./skel/, ./templates/)?
- Are all version references accurate (1.4.0 target)?
- Do workflow examples match current command structure?
- Are dependency lists current (Node.js versions, tool versions)?

**Structural Review**:

- Should some docs be merged or split?
- Are docs in the right directories?
- Do navigation and cross-references work?
- Is the information hierarchy logical?

**Tasks**:

#### Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis

- [ ] **Audit all documentation files**: Create inventory with purpose, target audience, last update
- [ ] **Architecture reference check**: Find all references to old structure (./skel/, controlled duplication, etc.)
- [ ] **Cross-reference validation**: Check all internal links and references between docs
- [ ] **Redundancy identification**: Map overlapping content across files
- [ ] **Gap analysis**: Identify missing documentation for key workflows

#### Phase 2: Content Assessment

- [ ] **User journey mapping**: Trace new user → productive user → contributor paths through docs
- [ ] **Developer workflow mapping**: Trace development setup → feature development → testing paths
- [ ] **Usefulness scoring**: Rate each document's value and usage frequency
- [ ] **Balance evaluation**: Assess technical depth vs accessibility for each audience
- [ ] **Currency audit**: Flag outdated examples, commands, architecture references

#### Phase 3: Structural Brainstorming

- [ ] **Consolidation opportunities**: Identify docs that should be merged
- [ ] **Split candidates**: Find overly complex docs that need splitting
- [ ] **Reorganization proposals**: Suggest better directory structure or file naming
- [ ] **Navigation improvements**: Design better cross-linking and discovery

#### Phase 4: Actionable Recommendations

- [ ] **Priority fixes**: Critical updates needed immediately
- [ ] **Content improvements**: Rewrite/update recommendations with rationale
- [ ] **Structural changes**: Reorganization plan with migration strategy
- [ ] **Maintenance strategy**: Process for keeping docs current going forward

**Specific Focus Areas**:

**Architecture Documentation**:

- Remove all references to controlled duplication strategy
- Update build process descriptions to match single-source approach
- Verify all paths and commands match current structure

**User Experience**:

- Ensure WORKFLOW.md guides match actual DOH capabilities
- Verify README quick start works with current system
- Check that examples in docs/ are functional

**Developer Experience**:

- Ensure DEVELOPMENT.md covers current toolchain (make, npm, linting)
- Verify CLAUDE.md matches current project structure
- Check that analysis/ docs are still relevant

**Version Consistency**:

- Align all version references with current 1.4.0 development
- Update tool version requirements
- Ensure CHANGELOG.md properly tracks completed work

**Quality Criteria**:

- **Usefulness**: Each doc must serve a clear purpose for its audience
- **Currency**: All examples and references must work with current system
- **Balance**: Right level of detail for intended readers
- **Discoverability**: Clear navigation and logical organization
- **Maintainability**: Easy to keep updated as system evolves

**Deliverable**: Comprehensive documentation health report with prioritized action plan for improving DOH project
documentation quality, consistency, and user experience.
