### DOH028 - Development Environment Setup & Automation ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED ✅ - Developer toolchain  
**Priority**: Medium - Developer toolchain infrastructure  
**Dependencies**: DOH027 (linting system - required for hooks), DOH026 (restructure - optional)  
**Target Version**: 1.4.0 **Completed**: 2025-08-27

Design and implement development environment setup strategy with technology decisions for build automation, dependency
management, and contributor onboarding process.

**Impact**: Currently DOH lacks standardized development tooling and installation process. Need to decide on
technologies (make vs npm scripts vs custom bash), dependency management strategy (homebrew, apt, manual), and create
streamlined contributor onboarding.

**Technology Decisions**:

- **Build Automation**: Makefile chosen for universality and simplicity
- **Dependency Management**: Hybrid approach with intelligent package manager detection
- **Package Management**: npm + system packages for comprehensive coverage

**Implemented Structure**:

└── package.json             # Dev dependencies only
```

**Benefits**:

- Consistent development environment for all contributors
- Automated quality checks prevent issues before commits
- Streamlined onboarding for new DOH developers
- Foundation for DOH024 testing framework
- Professional development workflow matching DOH quality standards

**Deliverable**: ✅ COMPLETED Technology decisions documented with chosen build automation, dependency management
strategy, and streamlined contributor onboarding process.
