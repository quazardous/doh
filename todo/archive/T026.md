### T026 - Restructure DOH: Move non-runtime components outside .claude âœ…

**Status**: COMPLETED âœ… - All migration and references updated, functionality validated  
**Priority**: High - Project organization and self-hosting preparation (BLOCKS T022)  
**Dependencies**: T025 (completed)  
**Version**: 1.4.0 âœ… **Completed**: 2025-08-27

Restructure the DOH project by moving non-runtime components from `.claude/doh/` to project root directories for better
organization and preparation for standalone distribution.

**Impact**: Currently all DOH components are in `.claude/doh/` mixing runtime scripts with development files. Clean
separation improves project structure, makes non-runtime files more accessible, and prepares for T022 self-hosting where
DOH becomes its own standalone project.

**Migration Status Analysis**:

- âœ… `.claude/doh/docs/` â†’ `./docs/` (MIGRATED âœ…)
- âœ… `.claude/doh/templates/` â†’ `./templates/` (MIGRATED âœ…)
- âœ… `.claude/doh/skel/` â†’ `./skel/` (MIGRATED âœ…) **[Keep duplicate for runtime]**
- âœ… `.claude/doh/analysis/` â†’ `./analysis/` (MIGRATED âœ…)
- âœ… `.claude/doh/tests/` â†’ `./tests/` (MIGRATED âœ…)
- âœ… `.claude/doh/README.md` â†’ `./README.md` (MIGRATED âœ…)
- âœ… `.claude/doh/CHANGELOG.md` â†’ `./CHANGELOG.md` (MIGRATED âœ…)
- âœ… `.claude/doh/VERSION.md` â†’ `./VERSION.md` (MIGRATED âœ…)
- ðŸ”’ `.claude/doh/scripts/` - Runtime scripts (KEEP in .claude)
- ðŸ”’ `.claude/doh/inclaude.md` - AI integration context (KEEP in .claude)

**Benefits**:

- Cleaner separation between runtime and development components
- More conventional project layout for distribution
- Easier access to docs/analysis without navigating .claude
- Preparation for DOH self-hosting (T022)
- Better organization for contributors and end-users

**Deliverable**: Restructured DOH project with clean separation of runtime vs development components, all functionality
preserved, and comprehensive testing completed.
