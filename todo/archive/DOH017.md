### DOH017 - Bash Routine Expansion Analysis ðŸš©ðŸš© (EPIC Phase 1)

**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Priority**: High - Capitalize on DOH013 POC success  
**Dependencies**: DOH013 (bash scripts), DOH014 (data structure analysis)  
**Proposed Version**: 1.5.0  
**Epic**: EDOH077 Natural Language & Performance Optimization

Analyze current DOH command usage patterns and identify next batch of bash routine candidates to maximize token savings
and performance gains.

**Impact**: DOH013 POC proved bash optimization delivers 150-500x performance gains and 100% token savings for routine
operations. Need systematic analysis to identify which additional operations should be bash-scripted next for maximum
ROI.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Audit current Claude command usage patterns in typical DOH workflows
- [ ] Identify high-frequency operations not yet bash-optimized (search, update, validate)
- [ ] Analyze complexity vs benefit ratio for medium-priority operations from DOH014
- [ ] Map dependencies between operations (which scripts enable other scripts)
- [ ] Prioritize next 5-10 bash routine candidates by frequency Ã— token savings
- [ ] Estimate development effort vs savings for each candidate
- [ ] Create implementation roadmap with quick wins vs strategic investments
- [ ] Document bash routine architecture patterns for consistent implementation
- [ ] Define testing strategy for bash routine quality assurance
- [ ] Plan integration with existing lib/doh.sh unified library

**Candidate Operations Analysis**: Based on DOH014 findings, analyze these operation categories:

- **Search Operations**: `search-tasks.sh`, `find-by-title.sh`, `grep-content.sh`
- **Update Operations**: `update-status.sh`, `update-metadata.sh`, `batch-update.sh`
- **Validation Operations**: `validate-structure.sh`, `check-dependencies.sh`, `lint-markdown.sh`
- **File Operations**: `list-files.sh`, `count-by-type.sh`, `recent-changes.sh`
- **Query Operations**: `epic-tasks.sh`, `status-summary.sh`, `dependency-graph.sh`

**Deliverable**: Prioritized roadmap for next wave of bash routine implementation with effort estimates, ROI
calculations, and implementation patterns for consistent script development.
