### DOH029 - Clean up migrated files from .claude/doh after DOH026 restructuring ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED ✅ - 2025-08-27 **Priority**: Medium - Post-migration cleanup  
**Dependencies**: DOH026 (restructuring completion)  
**Version**: 1.4.0 **Completed**: 2025-08-27

Clean up `.claude/doh/` directory by removing successfully migrated components and empty directories after DOH026
restructuring is complete.

**Impact**: After DOH026 migration, `.claude/doh/` will contain duplicate files and empty directories that should be
removed to maintain clean project structure. This cleanup task ensures no stale files remain and validates migration
success.

**Completed Actions**:

- Validated all migrated components work correctly at new locations
- Confirmed all hardcoded `.claude/doh/` paths updated for migrated components
- Tested DOH commands to ensure no broken references to migrated files
- Successfully removed duplicate directories from .claude/doh/
- Preserved runtime components in .claude/doh/scripts/
- Maintained functionality throughout cleanup process

**Final State**:

```text
.claude/doh/
├── scripts/           # Runtime scripts only (PRESERVED)
│   ├── lib/          # Bash libraries (doh.sh, doh-config.sh, etc.)
│   └── *.sh         # DOH runtime scripts (100% bash + jq + awk)
├── skel/             # Runtime skeleton (PRESERVED for /doh:init)
├── templates/        # Runtime templates (PRESERVED for DOH agents)
└── inclaude.md       # Keep Claude integration docs
```

**Deliverable**: ✅ COMPLETED Clean `.claude/doh/` directory containing only runtime components, with all migrated files
removed and functionality preserved.
