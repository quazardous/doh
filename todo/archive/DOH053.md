### DOH053 - DOH Skeleton Enhancement for Human-Readable Analysis ðŸš©

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED (2025-08-27)  
**Priority**: HIGH - Epic EDOH074 Phase 1 analysis foundation  
**Dependencies**: None (builds on stable 1.3.0 skeleton)  
**Target Version**: 1.4.0  
**Epic**: EDOH074 DOH Version 1.4.0 Release  
**Estimated Effort**: 1.5 hours

Enhance the existing stable 1.3.0 skeleton structure to support one-shot codebase analysis with human-readable output.
Focus on Markdown-based analysis reports and natural language insights rather than JSON structures optimized for
querying.

**Impact**: The stable 1.3.0 skeleton needs enhancement to support human-readable codebase analysis for easier DOH
adoption on existing projects. Analysis is a one-shot task requiring clear insights, not fast queries - prioritize human
readability over structured data optimization.

**Core Architecture Requirements**:

**DOH Methodology Enforcement**:

- **Structural Discipline**: Enforces PRD â†’ Epic â†’ Feature â†’ Task hierarchy
- **Process Compliance**: All `/doh` commands must follow DOH workflow standards
- **Traceability Mandates**: Every work item connects to business objectives
- **Memory Context**: Persistent project intelligence vs ephemeral Claude interactions
- **Workflow Guidance**: Built-in methodology coaching and compliance checking

**Memory Context Foundation**:

- **Project Persistence**: Commands build on accumulated project knowledge
- **Decision Tracking**: Memory system preserves rationale and context
- **Session Continuity**: Command interactions maintain state across time
- **Team Coordination**: Shared memory enables collaborative project management

**Tasks**:

#### Phase 1: Core Skeleton Structure (1.5h)

- [x] **Create `.claude/doh/skel/` directory structure** with human-readable analysis focus
- [x] **Design `project-index.json` schema** with analysis summary fields for natural language insights
  - Project metadata, codebase summary in natural language, analysis timestamp
- [x] **Create analysis output templates** in Markdown format for human consumption
  - `analysis-report.md` - Main codebase analysis template
  - `epic-suggestions.md` - DOH organization recommendations template
  - `patterns-detected.md` - Architectural patterns in plain language
  - `team-insights.md` - Team collaboration patterns analysis
- [x] **Create structured `.gitignore`** with DOH-specific sections and methodology protection
- [x] **Establish memory architecture** with project/, epics/, agent-sessions/ foundations
  - `memory/project/` - Project-level patterns, decisions, and context
  - `memory/epics/` - Epic-specific memory and progress tracking
  - `memory/agent-sessions/` - Development session context and artifacts

#### Phase 2: Methodology Templates (2h)

- [x] **Create Epic #0 template** (`epics/quick/epic0.md`) with DOH methodology guidance
- [x] **Design task templates** with mandatory traceability and status discipline
- [x] **Create feature templates** with epic connections and deliverable tracking
- [x] **Build methodology documentation** embedded in skeleton structure
  - Uses existing `.claude/doh/templates/` for task/feature/epic templates
  - Enhanced Epic #0 template with DOH methodology guidance
  - Memory system templates for agent sessions

#### Phase 3: Memory & Context System (1.5h)

- [ ] **Design memory initialization** for project context establishment
- [ ] **Create context loading mechanisms** for `/doh` command execution
- [ ] **Build memory update protocols** for maintaining project state
- [ ] **Implement session continuity** for command interaction history

#### Phase 4: Command Integration (2h)

- [ ] **Update `/doh:init` command** to use skeleton with methodology enforcement
- [ ] **Add methodology compliance validation** to skeleton deployment
- [ ] **Create migration strategy** for existing `.doh/` projects
- [ ] **Build methodology coaching features** into command responses

#### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (1.5h)

- [ ] **Test skeleton deployment** on new projects with methodology validation
- [ ] **Validate memory context loading** across multiple command sessions
- [ ] **Test methodology enforcement** with various command scenarios
- [ ] **Verify backward compatibility** with existing DOH projects

#### Phase 6: Documentation & Integration (1h)

- [ ] **Update command documentation** to reflect methodology enforcement
- [ ] **Create skeleton usage guide** with DOH workflow examples
- [ ] **Document memory context architecture** for future development

**Methodology Compliance Features**:

**Structural Enforcement**:

- All tasks MUST belong to an epic (Epic #0 or dedicated epic)
- All epics MUST follow DOH template structure with proper documentation
- All features MUST connect to epics and contain structured task breakdown
- Project structure MUST maintain proper hierarchy and traceability

**Process Enforcement**:

- Status transitions MUST follow DOH workflow (PROPOSED â†’ IN PROGRESS â†’ COMPLETED)
- Task completion MUST update epic progress and memory context
- Epic graduation MUST be suggested when Epic #0 exceeds threshold
- Memory context MUST be updated with every significant project decision

**Quality Assurance**:

- Templates MUST include methodology guidance and examples
- Validation MUST check for proper DOH structure compliance
- Memory system MUST preserve decision rationale and project evolution
- Commands MUST provide methodology coaching when structure issues detected

**Performance Targets**:

- Skeleton deployment: <5 seconds for complete project initialization
- Memory context loading: <200ms for typical project state
- Methodology validation: <100ms for structure compliance checking
- Command execution: Context-aware responses within standard performance limits

**Success Criteria**:

- All `/doh` commands enforce strict methodology compliance
- Memory context provides persistent project intelligence across sessions
- Skeleton enables consistent DOH project structure across all users
- Methodology coaching guides users toward best practices automatically
- Template structure scales from personal projects to team collaboration

**Deliverable**: Complete DOH skeleton system with methodology enforcement, memory context architecture, and integrated
command foundation that transforms `/doh` commands into disciplined project management workflow vs free-form
interactions.
