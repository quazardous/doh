### DOH048 - Audit & Enforce DOH Internal/Runtime Pattern Isolation (Chinese Wall) ðŸš©

**Status**: COMPLETED âœ…  
**Priority**: High - Prevents cross-contamination and confusion  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Target Version**: 1.4.1  
**Tags**: `#doc` `#architecture`

Audit all DOH documentation and establish a "Chinese Wall" information barrier between DOH system internal development
patterns (TODO.md, Epic EDOH077) and runtime `/doh` command patterns that users employ in their projects.

**Impact**: Previously, documentation mixed internal DOH development concepts with user-facing `/doh` runtime patterns,
creating confusion about which patterns apply where. This led to incorrect assumptions and implementation mistakes.

**Core Issues to Address**:

**Documentation Cross-Contamination**:

- Internal DOH epic numbering (EDOH077) appearing in `/doh` command documentation
- TODO.md patterns being referenced in user-facing `/doh` guides
- DOH system development workflows mixed with user project workflows
- Template documentation containing internal development references

**Pattern Isolation Requirements**:

- **Internal DOH Development**: TODO.md, T/E numbering, /doh-sys commands, DOH system architecture
- **Runtime /doh Commands**: .doh/ structure, user project epics/tasks, /doh command patterns
- **Clear Boundaries**: No mixing of internal patterns with user-facing documentation

**Tasks**:

#### Phase 1: Documentation Audit (1.5h)

- [ ] **Scan all `.claude/commands/doh/` files** for references to TODO.md, T/E numbering, or internal patterns
- [ ] **Review all template files** for internal DOH development references
- [ ] **Audit user-facing documentation** (README.md, WORKFLOW.md, docs/) for internal pattern leakage
- [ ] **Check command examples** for mixing internal and runtime patterns

#### Phase 2: Pattern Isolation Enforcement (2h)

- [ ] **Remove internal references** from `/doh` command documentation
- [ ] **Clean template files** of DOH system development concepts
- [ ] **Update user guides** to focus purely on runtime `/doh` usage
- [ ] **Create isolation guidelines** for future documentation

#### Phase 3: Architecture Documentation (1h)

- [ ] **Document pattern boundaries** clearly in DEVELOPMENT.md
- [ ] **Create isolation checklist** for new documentation
- [ ] **Add review guidelines** to prevent future cross-contamination
- [ ] **Update contributor guidelines** with separation requirements

#### Phase 4: Validation & Testing (1h)

- [ ] **Test user workflow documentation** without internal references
- [ ] **Validate command examples** work in real user projects
- [ ] **Verify template consistency** across all `/doh` commands
- [ ] **Check cross-reference accuracy** in all documentation

**Success Criteria**:

- Zero references to TODO.md, T/E numbering in `/doh` command documentation
- Clear distinction between DOH system development and user project patterns
- User-facing documentation focuses purely on runtime `/doh` usage
- Internal development documentation clearly marked as DOH system specific
- Chinese Wall policy documented and enforced

**Deliverables Completed**:

- âœ… Fixed CONTRIBUTING.md (removed DOH024 reference)
- âœ… Added "Documentation Pattern Boundaries" section to DEVELOPMENT.md
- âœ… Created `docs/pattern-isolation-guide.md` with Chinese Wall policy
- âœ… Added review checklist for future contributions
- âœ… Validated all user-facing docs are clean of internal patterns

**Result**: Complete "Chinese Wall" separation achieved between DOH internal development patterns and user-facing
runtime patterns, with enforcement guide and validation process in place.
