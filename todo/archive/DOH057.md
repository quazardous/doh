### DOH057 - TODO System Refactoring into Structured Folder Approach ðŸš©

**Status**: COMPLETED (2025-08-27)  
**Priority**: HIGH - Critical for project organization and scalability  
**Dependencies**: None (can be done independently)  
**Target Version**: 1.4.0  
**Tags**: `#doc` `#architecture` `#refactoring`

Refactor the current TODO.md and TODOARCHIVED.md files into a structured folder approach with individual files for each
TODO and better organization.

**Impact**: Current monolithic TODO.md file has become unwieldy with over 2500 lines and contains completed, active, and
proposed TODOs mixed together. This creates maintenance overhead, difficult navigation, and poor developer experience. A
structured folder approach will improve maintainability, searchability, and collaboration.

**Current Issues**:

- **File Size**: TODO.md is over 2500 lines - difficult to navigate and edit
- **Mixed Content**: Active, completed, and proposed TODOs mixed in single file
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Manual archiving process prone to errors
- **Poor Searchability**: Hard to find specific TODOs or track progress
- **Version Control Conflicts**: Multiple developers editing monolithic file causes merge conflicts
- **Documentation Fragmentation**: TODO management instructions scattered across files

**Proposed Structure**:

```
todo/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                 # TODO management documentation and guidelines
â”œâ”€â”€ active/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DOH054.md              # Individual active TODO files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DOH055.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DOH056.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ proposed/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DOH044.md              # Proposed TODOs awaiting approval
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DOH045.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ archive/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DOH013.md              # Completed TODOs with full history
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DOH017.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DOH027.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ epics/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ EDOH074.md              # Epic definitions and progress tracking
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ EDOH076.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ EDOH077.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ templates/
    â”œâ”€â”€ todo-template.md     # Template for new TODOs
    â”œâ”€â”€ epic-template.md     # Template for new Epics
    â””â”€â”€ guidelines.md        # TODO creation and management guidelines
```

**Benefits**:

- **Individual Files**: Each TODO in separate file for easy editing and tracking
- **Clear Organization**: Active/Proposed/Archive separation prevents confusion
- **Better Version Control**: Reduced merge conflicts with individual files
- **Enhanced Searchability**: File-based search and organization
- **Automated Management**: Scripts can manage TODO lifecycle automatically
- **Improved Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different TODOs simultaneously
- **Documentation Centralization**: All TODO management in `todo/README.md`

**Tasks**:

#### Phase 1: Structure Design & Setup (2h)

- [ ] **Create folder structure**: Set up `todo/` with `active/`, `proposed/`, `archive/`, `epics/` subdirectories
- [ ] **Design file naming**: Consistent naming convention (T###.md, E###.md)
- [ ] **Create templates**: Standard templates for TODOs and Epics with required metadata
- [ ] **Write management documentation**: Comprehensive `todo/README.md` with guidelines

#### Phase 2: Content Migration (3h)

- [ ] **Migrate active TODOs**: Extract active TODOs to individual files in `active/`
- [ ] **Migrate proposed TODOs**: Move proposed TODOs to `proposed/` folder
- [ ] **Migrate completed TODOs**: Move archived TODOs to `archive/` folder
- [ ] **Extract Epics**: Create individual Epic files in `epics/` folder
- [ ] **Preserve metadata**: Ensure all TODO metadata, dependencies, and history preserved

#### Phase 3: Tooling & Automation (2h)

- [ ] **Create management scripts**: Scripts for creating, updating, archiving TODOs
- [ ] **Update /doh-sys commands**: Modify changelog/commit commands to work with new structure
- [ ] **Add validation**: Scripts to validate TODO structure and metadata consistency
- [ ] **Create overview generation**: Auto-generate overview/index files from individual TODOs

#### Phase 4: Documentation Updates (1h)

- [ ] **Update DEVELOPMENT.md**: Reference `todo/README.md` for TODO management
- [ ] **Update CLAUDE.md**: Remove TODO references, point to new structure
- [ ] **Create migration guide**: Document migration process for future reference
- [ ] **Update workflows**: Ensure all development workflows adapted to new structure

**File Format Standards**:

Each TODO file will contain:

```markdown
# DOH057 - Title

**Status**: COMPLETED | PROPOSED | COMPLETED  
**Priority**: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW  
**Dependencies**: T###, T###  
**Epic**: E###  
**Tags**: #tag1, #tag2  
**Estimated Effort**: X hours  
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Completed**: YYYY-MM-DD (if applicable)

## Description

[TODO description and impact]

## Tasks

- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## Notes

[Implementation notes, decisions, references]
```

**Integration with DEVELOPMENT.md**:

The `todo/README.md` will become the single source of truth for TODO management, referenced from DEVELOPMENT.md:

```markdown
## Task Management

ðŸ“‹ **TODO Management**: See `todo/README.md` for complete TODO system documentation, workflows, and guidelines.
```

**Validation & Quality Assurance**:

- **Metadata Consistency**: Validate required fields in all TODO files
- **Dependency Tracking**: Ensure all references between TODOs are valid
- **Epic Consistency**: Validate Epic/TODO relationships and progress tracking
- **Naming Conventions**: Enforce consistent file naming and structure

**Migration Strategy**:

- **Parallel Development**: New structure developed alongside current system
- **Gradual Migration**: TODOs migrated in batches to avoid disruption
- **Validation Phase**: Extensive testing before switching to new system
- **Rollback Plan**: Ability to revert to current system if issues arise

**Success Criteria**:

- All current TODO content migrated without loss
- New structure improves navigation and maintenance experience
- Documentation centralized in `todo/README.md` and referenced from DEVELOPMENT.md
- Automated tools working with new structure
- Developer workflow improved with reduced conflicts and better organization

**Deliverable**: Structured `todo/` folder system with individual TODO files, centralized documentation in
`todo/README.md`, automated management tools, and integration with existing DOH development workflows.
