### DOH042 - DOH Security Analysis & Threat Modeling ðŸ”’

**Status**: PROPOSED  
**Priority**: High - Foundation for secure distribution  
**Dependencies**: None (pure analysis/brainstorming task)  
**Proposed Version**: 1.4.0 **Tags**: `#security` `#think` **Analysis**: Will create
`analysis/DOH042-security-threat-model.md`

Conduct comprehensive security analysis and threat modeling for the DOH system to identify vulnerabilities, attack
vectors, and defensive measures before 1.4.0 release and distribution.

**Impact**: DOH system handles sensitive development workflows (git operations, file system access, command execution,
project data). A security analysis is critical before distribution to identify and mitigate potential risks, ensure
secure defaults, and establish security best practices.

**Threat Surface Analysis**:

**File System Operations**:

- DOH reads/writes `.doh/` directories with project data
- Template deployment via `/doh:init` creates files in project directories
- Bash scripts access file system with user permissions
- Path traversal risks in file operations
- Symlink attacks on `.doh/` directory access

**Command Execution**:

- Bash scripts execute with user privileges
- Git operations (commit, rebase, push) with user credentials
- Shell command injection risks in user inputs
- Environment variable access and manipulation
- Process execution and subprocess spawning

**Data Handling**:

- Project metadata storage in `.doh/project-index.json`
- Task/Epic content with potentially sensitive information
- Memory files storing project context and history
- Git history access and manipulation
- Configuration data processing

**Network Operations**:

- GitHub/GitLab API access with user tokens
- Repository synchronization with remote systems
- Webhook endpoints and external integrations
- Man-in-the-middle attack vectors
- API credential exposure risks

**AI Integration**:

- Claude API communication with project data
- Prompt injection through user inputs
- Data leakage through AI model interactions
- Context contamination between projects
- Sensitive information in AI requests

**Tasks**:

#### Phase 1: Threat Identification (2-3h)

- [ ] **Attack Surface Mapping**: Catalog all DOH system entry points, data flows, and trust boundaries
- [ ] **Threat Actor Analysis**: Identify potential attackers (malicious users, compromised systems, insider threats)
- [ ] **Attack Vector Enumeration**: Document specific attack methods for each system component
- [ ] **Asset Classification**: Identify sensitive data and critical system components requiring protection
- [ ] **Trust Boundary Analysis**: Map data flows between trusted/untrusted contexts

#### Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment (2-3h)

- [ ] **Code Security Review**: Analyze bash scripts for injection vulnerabilities, path traversal, privilege escalation
- [ ] **Input Validation Analysis**: Examine all user input processing points for sanitization gaps
- [ ] **File System Security**: Review file permissions, directory creation, symlink handling
- [ ] **Credential Handling**: Analyze token storage, API key management, git credential access
- [ ] **Configuration Security**: Review default configurations for security misconfigurations

#### Phase 3: Risk Analysis & Prioritization (1-2h)

- [ ] **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate potential damage from successful attacks
- [ ] **Likelihood Analysis**: Assess probability of various attack scenarios
- [ ] **Risk Matrix Creation**: Prioritize security issues by impact Ã— likelihood
- [ ] **Exploitability Analysis**: Evaluate ease of exploiting identified vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Business Impact Evaluation**: Assess risks to user projects and organizational security

#### Phase 4: Mitigation Strategy Design (2-3h)

- [ ] **Defense in Depth Strategy**: Design layered security controls
- [ ] **Secure Defaults**: Establish secure default configurations and behaviors
- [ ] **Input Sanitization**: Design comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- [ ] **Privilege Minimization**: Implement least-privilege principles
- [ ] **Monitoring & Detection**: Design security monitoring and anomaly detection
- [ ] **Incident Response**: Plan security incident response procedures

#### Phase 5: Security Architecture Recommendations (1-2h)

- [ ] **Security Controls Implementation**: Recommend specific security measures for each component
- [ ] **Security Testing Strategy**: Design security testing approach (static analysis, penetration testing)
- [ ] **Security Documentation**: Create security guidelines for users and developers
- [ ] **Compliance Considerations**: Address regulatory and organizational security requirements
- [ ] **Security Metrics**: Define security KPIs and monitoring metrics

**Brainstorming Areas**:

**Defensive Security Focus**:

- Input validation and sanitization strategies
- File system access controls and sandboxing
- Secure credential storage and handling
- API security and rate limiting
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Security configuration management
- Error handling without information disclosure

**Secure Development Practices**:

- Security code review guidelines
- Secure coding standards for bash scripts
- Security testing integration (SAST/DAST)
- Dependency security scanning
- Security-focused documentation
- Developer security training recommendations

**Deployment Security**:

- Secure distribution mechanisms
- Package integrity verification
- Installation security checks
- Update mechanism security
- Configuration security validation
- User permission requirements

**Operational Security**:

- Runtime security monitoring
- Anomaly detection for unusual behavior
- Security incident response procedures
- User security guidelines
- Security maintenance procedures
- Backup and recovery security

**Success Criteria**:

- Comprehensive threat model document created
- All major attack vectors identified and analyzed
- Risk-prioritized mitigation recommendations
- Security implementation roadmap for development
- Security testing strategy defined
- User security guidelines established

**Deliverable**: Complete security analysis document (`analysis/DOH042-security-threat-model.md`) with actionable
security recommendations, threat model, risk assessment, and implementation roadmap for secure DOH system deployment.
