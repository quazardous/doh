**Status**: Architecture scattered  
**Priority**: High - Required for /doh distribution  
**Dependencies**: T001 (skeleton)

Consolidate scattered /doh components into distributable package with installation system.

**Impact**: Currently /doh components are scattered across project making distribution impossible. Blocks /doh adoption
by other teams.

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Design distribution package structure
- [ ] Create installation script (install.sh)
- [ ] Create uninstallation script (uninstall.sh)
- [ ] Package all /doh components
- [ ] Create example projects
- [ ] Test installation on clean systems

**Deliverable**: Distributable /doh system package with bulletproof installation.
