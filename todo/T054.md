# T054 - DOH Skeleton Memory & Context System ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority**: HIGH - Epic E074 Phase 1  
**Dependencies**: T053 (COMPLETED)  
**Epic**: E074 DOH Version 1.4.0 Release  
**Tags**: `#features` `#build` `#skeleton`  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours  
**Created**: 2025-08-28  
**Completed**: 2025-08-28  

ðŸ§  **COMPREHENSIVE BRAINSTORM & ANALYSIS**

Advanced memory context system for DOH skeleton to enable analysis persistence, project intelligence, and enhanced codebase understanding capabilities.

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: This task is the foundation that transforms DOH from a static template system into an intelligent, context-aware project management framework. The memory system bridges the gap between ephemeral Claude interactions and persistent project knowledge.

## ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Analysis

### Core Mission

Transform DOH from a static template system into an **intelligent project companion** that accumulates knowledge, learns patterns, and provides contextual guidance across development sessions.

### ðŸ§© Architecture Philosophy

**Memory as Intelligence**: The system creates a persistent "brain" for each project that:

- **Learns** from development patterns and decisions
- **Remembers** context across Claude sessions
- **Guides** future development with accumulated insights
- **Connects** disparate work items through intelligent context

### ðŸ”„ Transformation Framework

```
Static Templates â†’ Dynamic Intelligence â†’ Autonomous Guidance
     (1.3.0)    â†’    (1.4.0 T054)    â†’   (Future 2.0)
```

### ðŸ’¡ Key Breakthroughs

**1. Session Continuity Revolution**

- **Problem**: Every Claude interaction starts from zero context
- **Solution**: Rich memory that restores full project understanding instantly
- **Impact**: Conversations become progressions, not restarts

**2. Pattern Recognition Intelligence**

- **Problem**: Repeated architectural decisions without learning
- **Solution**: Memory captures and suggests proven patterns
- **Impact**: Accelerated development through accumulated wisdom

**3. Multi-Dimensional Context**

- **Problem**: Flat file structures lose relationship intelligence
- **Solution**: Layered memory (Project â†’ Epic â†’ Session) with cross-references
- **Impact**: Rich contextual understanding for complex projects

**4. Human-Readable Intelligence**

- **Problem**: JSON structures optimized for machines, not humans
- **Solution**: Markdown-first memory that humans can read, edit, and understand
- **Impact**: Transparent AI reasoning with manual override capabilities

- [ ] **Validate context continuity** for complex project analysis workflows
- [ ] **Ensure methodology compliance** with DOH architectural standards

## Technical Requirements

### Memory Structure

**Current Structure** (.claude/doh/skel/):

```
.doh/
â”œâ”€â”€ epics/                  # Epic definitions (epic0.md, epic1.md, etc.)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ quick/epic0.md     
â””â”€â”€ memory/                 # Memory system
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          # Memory system documentation
    â”œâ”€â”€ project/           # Project-level memory
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ .gitkeep      # architectural-decisions.md, project-patterns.md, etc.
    â”œâ”€â”€ epics/             # Epic-specific memory
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ .gitkeep      # epic-{ID}/ folders with context.md, decisions.md, progress.md
    â””â”€â”€ agent-sessions/    # Session memory
        â””â”€â”€ .gitkeep      # active/, completed/, session-{timestamp}.md files
```

**Memory File Templates**:

**Project Level** (`memory/project/`):

- `architectural-decisions.md` - Key architectural choices and rationale
- `project-patterns.md` - Established patterns and conventions  
- `team-context.md` - Team composition, roles, and working agreements
- `strategic-context.md` - Business context, goals, and priorities

**Epic Level** (`memory/epics/epic-{ID}/`):

- `context.md` - Epic background, goals, and strategic context
- `decisions.md` - Epic-specific implementation decisions
- `progress.md` - Detailed progress tracking and milestone analysis
- `learnings.md` - Insights and lessons learned during execution

**Agent Sessions** (`memory/agent-sessions/`):

- `active/` - Currently active session data (excluded from Git)
- `completed/` - Archived completed sessions
- `session-{timestamp}.md` - Individual session logs with decisions and outcomes

**Memory Organization Benefits**:

- âœ… **Separation of Concerns**: Epic definitions vs epic memory clearly separated
- âœ… **Centralized Memory**: All memory types in dedicated `/memory/` folder
- âœ… **Consistent Structure**: Uniform approach to project/epic/session memory
- âœ… **Clear Purpose**: `/epics/` for definitions, `/memory/` for context and decisions

### Memory Operations

- **Context Loading**: Restore project state for command execution
- **State Persistence**: Save analysis results and project insights
- **History Tracking**: Maintain evolution of project understanding
- **Session Continuity**: Link command executions for coherent workflows

### Integration Points

- **T055 Integration**: Memory system enables intelligent command routing
- **T056 Testing**: Memory persistence validates across test scenarios
- **Analysis Commands**: Memory stores human-readable analysis results
- **Project Adoption**: Memory tracks DOH methodology compliance

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **Memory persistence functional** across DOH command sessions
- [ ] **Project context maintained** with intelligent state management
- [ ] **Analysis results stored** in human-readable format
- [ ] **Session continuity achieved** for complex workflows
- [ ] **Integration ready** for T055 command integration phase
- [ ] **Architecture validated** against DOH methodology standards

## Implementation Notes

**Foundation Approach**: Build on T053 skeleton structure, extending with memory capabilities rather than replacing core functionality.

**Human-Readable Focus**: All memory storage uses Markdown and JSON for easy inspection and manual editing when needed.

**Methodology Compliance**: Memory system enforces DOH architectural standards and maintains traceability discipline.

**Performance Considerations**: Memory operations designed for fast context loading and efficient persistence without impacting command execution speed.

## Deliverable

Functional DOH skeleton memory and context system that provides persistent project intelligence, analysis result storage, and session continuity - enabling Epic E074 Phase 1 progression and positioning for advanced analysis capabilities in DOH Version 1.4.0.
